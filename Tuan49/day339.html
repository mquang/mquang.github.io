      <p>Hi! My name is Phoebe, I am fifteen. I don’t want you to be <mark>deceived</mark> by my <u title="lạc quan (ngày 86)">optimistic</u> voice. My story will be the most sad, <u title="đáng sợ (ngày 298)">frightening</u>, and strangest one ever. Well, it's about how my mother decided to <mark>orchestrate</mark> an unusual casting call – in a search for new parents for me. Because she's going to die soon.</p>

      <p>Everything happened very fast. Just… just like that: on one not very pleasant day, my mother felt bad. Before that day my Mom felt weak and <u title="chóng mặt (ngày 167)">dizzy</u> pretty often, so I had <u title="quen (ngày 10)">gotten used to</u> it and did not <u title="cho là (ngày 261)">perceive</u> it as something <u title="bất thường (ngày 85)">out of the ordinary</u>. Moreover, my mother’s <u title="thái độ (ngày 6)">attitude</u> toward doctors and their <u title="phòng khám (ngày 62)">clinics</u> and their medical checks was pretty <u title="tiêu cực, xấu (ngày 86)">negative</u>. In other words – feeling bad, for her, was not a reason to go and see the doctor. She preferred to always solve these problems in the same way – she would simply say that she was tired, and <mark>take a nap</mark> on the sofa.</p>

      <p>However, after a while my mother could not continue <u title="làm ngơ (ngày 206)">ignoring</u> her health problems – because she had started to <u title="ngất xỉu (ngày 327)">faint</u>. And not just at home, but also at where she worked. My mother works in a huge hypermarket, with large sales floors and real <mark>labyrinths</mark> between shelves with goods. And when some shoppers <u title="hoảng loạn (ngày 292)">panicked</u> because they had almost run over my mother with their shopping cart… (Mom was lying <u title="bất tỉnh (ngày 181)">unconscious</u> near the pet food shelves…) her <u title="quản lý, người giám sát (ngày 26)">supervisor</u> <u title="khiển trách (ngày 235)">reprimanded</u> her and <u title="khăng khăng đòi, yêu cầu (ngày 275)">insisted</u> that she go through a full medical screening. My mother tried to avoid it. Not only because she did not want to, but also because she had not <mark>renewed</mark> her <u title="bảo hiểm y tế (ngày 21)">medical insurance</u>. But the supervisor said that if she didn't <u title="tìm ra nguyên nhân (bị ngất xỉu) (ngày 63)">figure this out</u>, she would <u title="bị sa thải (ngày 137)">get fired</u>.</p>


      <p>So, she went to a medical clinic and got a <dfn data-inf="(n) khám">check-up</dfn>. The results of the tests were not just bad. When we learned the truth, our life <u title="sụp đổ (ngày 150)">fell apart</u> like a house of cards. Oh, it's hard for me to talk about... Inside my mother’s head, doctors found a <mark>tumor</mark>. And this tumor had been growing for a long time already. It began long before my mother began fainting regularly… And even after it started, my mother did not see the doctor for a long, long time, and did nothing about it! And now it was too late to operate and… too late to do anything, to put it simply. My mother <u title="xao nhãng, bỏ bê, thờ ơ (ngày 272)">neglected</u> her state of health for so long, saving money by not paying for her medical insurance, that now it was not possible to <dfn data-inf="(v) cứu chữa">cure</dfn> her… You see? Totally impossible. There was no sense in even trying! The only thing that we could try to do was to <mark>prolong</mark> my Mom’s life. But this therapy was very painful and would cost a <u title="rất nhiều tiền (ngày 269)">fortune</u> without insurance. So my mother decided that she would rather live a little bit less time, but will not become a <mark>senseless vegetable</mark>, lying in a hospital bed. Oh, My God! Just listen to how that sounds! And imagine that I have to live with it.</p>

      <p>After my mother learned about her terrible illness, she was totally <u title="tàn tạ (ngày 207)">ruined</u>… but only for a few days. And after that, my mother became surprisingly calm and even… cheerful. She even began to <u title="ăn mặc diện (ngày 158)">dress up</u> a little bit more <u title="thanh lịch, đoan trang (ngày 290)">elegantly</u> than she used to, willingly and happily went to work at her hypermarket, as she decided to keep her job until… until the very end, and it seemed that overall, she was in pretty good <u title="tinh thần (ngày 242)">spirits</u>. I could not understand this. Especially given that I knew about yet another problem that was on my mother’s mind.</p>

      <p>We did not have any relatives. I never knew my father, and both my grandparents died when I was a little kid. So it looked like after her death, I was going to be under the guardianship of social workers. But my mother trusted the social workers even less than the doctors. And so she decided that she would have to build my future while she still could. And she did it in quite an unusual manner.</p>

      <p>When my mother suddenly invited her colleague Trevor, with whom she worked together at the hypermarket, for dinner on Friday night, I had not <u title="nghi ngờ (ngày 276)">suspected</u> anything yet. Even though it was pretty strange. You see, we've lived quite a closed life together, I never brought home my school friends, and Mom also did not invite anybody to our home, and <u title="bất thình lình (ngày 326)">all of a sudden</u>, we are waiting for a man I had <dfn data-inf="gần như không,&#10;hầu như không">hardly</dfn> ever heard of. Anyway, the evening went pleasantly. My mother made some very tasty food, though usually she rarely bothered about what we ate. Trevor, even though his clothes were pretty untidy, looked like a nice person. Too bad he <dfn data-inf="(v-ed) thiếu">lacked</dfn> <dfn data-inf="khiếu hài hước">a sense of humor</dfn> — he did not tell a single joke during the whole evening, even though my mother tried very hard to create an easy-going atmosphere, and it was more than obvious that she did not want us to just be thinking about her illness.</p> 

      <p>When Trevor left, giving me a long and <u title="khá là (ngày 95)">somewhat</u> strange look, my mother simply shocked me with a question: “Phoebe, dear, how would you like it if Trevor becomes your father?” I don’t know if I would like it or not, because I was so surprised that I just became <u title="không nói nên lời (ngày 58)">speechless</u>. And my mother went on talking, saying out loud that Trevor was a good person who would be able to take care of me, and that he, for a long, long time, has been <mark>unrequitedly</mark> in love with her… I mean… with my Mom. At this point she suddenly stopped her <mark>monologue</mark>, as if something came to her mind, and said: “No, forget about it, it was a bad idea.” And added that by the next Friday she would <u title="chắc chắn (ngày 141)">definitely</u> <u title="mang đến (ngày 128)">come up with</u> something better.</p>

      <p>And you know, she did come up with something! For the whole week I did not want to <u title="đề cập đến (ngày 281)">bring up</u> the topic of this strange idea, because I suspected that this conversation might upset her. You see, you can’t even imagine what somebody, who only has a few months left to live, feels. I still can’t, even though this person lives so close to me… So I preferred to avoid any <u title="gây tranh cãi (ngày 244)">controversial</u> topics and tried to treat all my mother’s <u title="sự kì quặc, lập dị (ngày 303)">eccentricities</u> with understanding.</p>

      <p>And so, this time our dinner guest was Mrs.Glekky. She lived in the furthest to the right house in our block and was well-known in the neighborhood for her lack of family and presence of a whole crowd of cats that lived in her backyard. There were fifteen or sixteen cats, I am sure! So, of course I was very interested in why this aged, but still a strong, <mark>enterprising</mark> lady was visiting our house... I was expecting, with some fear, that my Mom would ask Mrs. Glekky if she had a <dfn data-inf="(adj) dư, không&#10;dùng đến">spare</dfn> basket for a pet named Phoebe, but she was patient and approached the main subject of the conversation from a distance.</p>

      <p>First she tried to find out if Mrs. Glekky really was a <mark>widow</mark>, as she'd heard <u title="những lời đàm tiếu (ngày 279)">gossip</u> around the neighborhood. But Mrs. Glekky <u title="cảm thấy bị xúc phạm (ngày 52)">was offended</u> by the <u title="sự thô lỗ (ngày 111)">rudeness</u> of that question and changed the subject. But I suppose that our neighbor knew very well why she was invited. She was eating her pie in tiny bits, she drank her tea slowly and thoughtfully, and she asked a lot of questions about me. They mainly concerned my <mark>diligence</mark> regarding house work. I am not a lazy person and I always help my mother, but for some reason I did not want to answer Mrs. Glekky’s questions. But my mother was joyfully <u title="khen ngợi (ngày 51)">praising</u> my hard working and seemed to almost make the decision, before Mrs. Glekky asked, “Does Phoebe have any experience in <u title="chăm sóc ">taking care of</u> animals?” After that, I think, my mother realized that Mrs. Glekky was looking for a <u title="người hầu, người giúp việc (ngày 111)">servant</u> at her zoo, so soon after that the widow was sent home.</p>

      <p>Another week passed. And I was fearfully expecting who would be the next guest of my mother’s on “Phoebe’s parents casting call.” Next Friday my mother was late coming home from work, so I had almost hoped with relief that this weekend would be quiet and peaceful but… that wasn’t going to happen! The doorbell rang, and my mother entered the house <u title="theo sau bởi (ngày 8)">accompanied by</u> two elderly people – a family couple, as I soon found out. As we were introduced, they said their names were Mr. and Mrs. Rogers. Can you imagine my <mark>astonishment</mark> when I realized that my mother had met them only a couple of hours before I did!</p>

      <p>Mr. and Mrs. Rogers were shoppers in my mother’s hypermarket and somehow they learned our story. The Rogers felt extremely sorry for my mother and volunteered to help us. And then my mother saw them as <u title="ứng cử viên tiềm năng (ngày 152 + 24)">potential candidates</u> to be my <u title="người giám hộ (ngày 303)">guardians</u>. The important part of the plan was that Mr. and Mrs. Rogers were, as it seemed, pretty rich. They had money and lived in a huge, but empty house. I politely asked the Rogers why were they living alone. They sadly replied that <u title="ngày trước">once upon a time</u>, long ago, they had a daughter but she died <mark>tragically</mark> when she was still very young… and they could not have any more children after her. Both my mother and I were very <u title="cảm động (ngày 335)">touched</u> by the story told by the Rogers, and I even started thinking that maybe it was not a bad idea – they have lost their daughter and I will soon lose my mother, and perhaps we could help each other to live through the <u title="(n) nỗi đau buồn mất mát (ngày 318)">grief</u> and become happy again? But when Mrs. Rogers asked, casually, if I would mind changing my name from Phoebe to Libby, because this was the name of their dead daughter, the magic was over and my mother saw this nice old couple <mark>off the premises</mark>.</p>

      <p>After that I decided that I had had enough. I wanted to talk to my mother and to ask her to stop this useless search for a guardian for me, but I understood that I simply did not know where to start. Then I went to my school teacher, Miss Green. I had always been on very good <u title ="mối quan hệ (ngày 27)">terms</u> with her, but I did not tell her about our situation… yet. Maybe this was the right time. Miss Green understood everything and agreed to come visit us that same day. And to talk to my mother – she was at home because she had <u title="ngày nghỉ">a day off</u> that day. And you know what we discovered when we saw her? My mother was carefully sorting our <u title="đồ đạc (ngày 1)">belongings</u>. Everything at home was getting a sticker, containing a note to whom it will be left according to her <mark>will</mark>: to her daughter Phoebe, to her colleagues, to charity. It felt strange and scary to see. Of course Miss Green and I stopped her. And it was probably only then I really understood how terrible my mother actually felt. I don't mean her illness, but what was deep inside her heart. I was very ashamed that I did not understand it before and that I could not find the words to support and <u title="(v) an ủi (ngày 68)">comfort</u> her. Miss Green did a better job at this than I did, she talked to her and they finally had a very honest conversation. My mother cried and <u title="thú nhận (ngày 151)">confessed</u> that she was simply very, very afraid of dying. I hugged her tightly and together with Miss Green we talked her out of looking for guardian for me.</p> 

      <p>I don’t know how much time we have left, my mother and I. But now I am doing my best to make her last months happier, and trying to <u title="bảo đảm, làm an tâm (ngày 21)">ensure</u> that she won’t be afraid. Because actually what she needs the most now is my support. And we decided to not think about what happens next. My teacher, Miss Green will let me stay with her for a while, and I feel comfortable about that. And whatever will be... will be.</p>
