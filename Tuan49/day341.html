      <p>Hi, I’m Lucy, and I’ve created an <mark>anonymous</mark> blog where I <u title="tiết lộ (ngày 297)">reveal</u> the secrets of people from my school. I just wanted <u title="trả đũa, trả thù (ngày 181)">revenge</u> on the girls that <u title="bắt nạt (ngày 313)">bullied</u> me, but it quickly got out of control…</p>

      <p>Let's start with a little bit of background: I was 15, wearing <mark>braces</mark>, and had HORRIBLE <mark>acne</mark> on my face. <u title="Không có gì to tát (ngày 110)">Not a big deal</u>, right? Yeah, right, but the older, popular girls were <u title="liên tục (ngày 193)">CONSTANTLY</u> <u title="chế giễu (ngày 294)">mocking</u> me for it. They would even laugh at me when I passed by them in school, and it hurt because they were <dfn data-inf="(adj) xinh đẹp">pretty</dfn> and everyone liked them.</p>

      <p>I told my older sister, Ashley, what was going on. We went to the same school and she said not to worry, because those girls had awkward secrets and they only made those jokes because they were <u title="thiếu tự tin (ngày 66)">insecure</u>. She told me all about them – one of them once made a very awkward video of herself covering a song, and it was so <mark>disastrous</mark> that she eventually deleted it, but some people (including my sister) still had it in their "<mark>possession</mark>.” It was pretty awkward, but not super bad.</p>

      <p>But another girl, on the other hand… turned out to be CONSTANLY lying about herself. Like, she would say her hair was naturally red, but it wasn’t true, and she would say that her parents were rich but they weren’t, and she would tell all of these crazy stories about her life, while in reality she was living a very <u title="bình thường (ngày 85)">ordinary</u> life. Once she even came up with a story that some man <mark>assaulted</mark> her but she ran away, and she was describing it in detail, but it <u title="được bịa ra (ngày 154)">was 100% made up</u>.</p>

      <p>My sister was also watching this pretty old show called "Gossip Girl” where a girl creates an anonymous blog where she revealed <u title="những tin đồn, lời đồn (ngày 223)">rumors</u> and <u title="kinh tởm (ngày 113)">horrible</u> truths about the other characters. So, naturally, I came up with a plan. I created an anonymous blog where I made several posts about those girls. I would write them in a very <mark>snarky</mark> and <mark>sarcastic</mark> manner. I even found that infamous video of the girl singing. I shared it in our school Facebook group, and the results were <u title="tuyệt vời (ngày 305)">GLORIOUS</u>. It turned out that a lot of people disliked these girls because they were so <mark>full of themselves</mark>, and it was really awesome to see how everyone reacted.</p>

      <p>Now, everyone was <u title="cười khúc khích (ngày 270)">giggling</u> and <u title="xì xào bàn tán (ngày 211)">whispering</u> about those girls and not about me. And the girls... they were extremely angry about it. Basically, I felt like a hero. The right thing to do was to <u title="bỏ (ngày 25)">abandon</u> this blog right away, but… I wanted MORE. Besides, other students started texting me different secrets about people. So I kept on doing this blog, posting stuff about people who deserved to be exposed. And then I would walk through school like a queen, although nobody knew it was me.</p>

      <p>But soon... I started to post almost anything "juicy," even about people who clearly didn’t deserve to be exposed or talked about in school. And the popularity of my blog <u title="-ed of rise<br>tăng lên (ngày 49)">rose</u>, so it was <u title="ảnh hưởng, tác động (ngày 55)">affecting</u> people more than when I began. Most of it was <u title="vô tội (ngày 223)">innocent</u> enough, but sometimes I exposed secret relationships some people had, and those posts were by far the most popular, but it often damaged the <u title="danh tiếng (ngày 150)">reputations</u> of some good people. I wasn’t a hero anymore, I was a <mark>villain</mark>!</p>

      <p>And the <u title="hậu quả (ngày 15)">consequences</u> finally came. I got a message, "I know who you are." It was <u title="đáng sợ (ngày 232)">terrifying</u>. I started to look around, trying to find someone who was looking at me... a little differently. I was extremely <u title="lo âu, sợ hãi, luôn nghi ngờ sẽ bị ai đó hãm hại (ngày 234)">paranoid</u> and was sure that a lot people were looking at me... weirdly. <u title="Hơn nữa (ngày 150)">Besides</u>, teachers finally found out about my blog. I even decided to make a post about myself to remove any <u title="nghi hoặc (ngày 276)">suspicions</u> around me, but I couldn’t do it in time, because something else happened...</p>

      <p>Later that evening, when I was at home, someone threw a stone through our window and broke it. My Dad and Mom were mad, thinking some <mark>vandals</mark> did it. But I knew that wasn’t true. And my sister also realized what was happening. She came to my room and asked if I was the gossip girl and if it was someone "getting revenge." I knew that I couldn’t lie, so I said "yes." Ashley said that I should immediately stop doing this blog and confess to my parents. I promised that I would stop doing the blog, but I didn’t want to tell my parents, but she said that if I wouldn’t confess myself, she would do it instead. So I <mark>caved in</mark> and told my parents everything... They were mad and <u title="cấm ra khỏi nhà chơi (ngày 227)">grounded</u> me, limiting my access to the internet. And with that I thought that it was finally over, but it wasn’t...</p>

      <p>A week after I ended my "career," my classmate Joe came up to me with a smile and said, "I’m glad you stopped doing this." I was shocked! I asked how he knew, he giggled and said, "I didn’t, I was watching you and you kinda changed right after this blog started. I wrote you a message to see how you would react, and you completely changed after you received it." I was impressed, but then I asked him, "...but why did you throw a stone through my window?" He was confused and said, "I didn’t." Then WHO was it!?</p>

      <p>The truth was soon revealed. Those two popular girls posted a long post, revealing the <u title="danh tính (ngày 247)">identity</u> of the gossip girl. Only... they said it was Ashley, my sister. They thought they "figured out" who could possibly know their secret in such detail and probably <mark>turned against</mark> each other at first, but then realized that my sister knew about it AND that she was into the "Gossip Girl" show. It was them, or maybe their boyfriends who threw a stone at our house! Ashley wasn’t even <u title="phủ nhận (ngày 42)">denying</u> it, she was trying to protect me. She took the <u title="trách nhiệm về lỗi lầm đã gây ra (ngày 181)">blame</u> and was facing <mark>detention</mark> and hatred from the entire school. I was <u title="sợ (ngày 84)">afraid</u>, but even more, I was <u title="xấu hổ, hổ thẹn (ngày 230)">ashamed of</u> how my actions had affected my sister. And all of this just because I felt insecure about my acne and braces!</p>

      <p>So I had to do the right thing. I made a post that, in fact, I had created this blog and everything connected to it. I went to my teacher and also told her the truth. People… started to hate me, yeah. And I got into a lot of trouble because of it. The popular girls continued to mock me, and almost everyone in our class stopped talking to me. But there were two people who stayed with me. Ashley was extremely proud of me and said that I did the right thing and that she was proud to have me as a sister. And the second person, surprisingly, was… Joe. For some reason, he wasn’t mad at me for doing the blog, he was very understanding, and said that he actually enjoyed trying to figure out who was it. And now we're friends!</p>

      <p>Recently, I got my braces removed, and of course people started to forget what I had done over time. Now I try to <u title="tập trung vào (ngày 3)">concentrate</u> on my <u title="sự tự tin, tự hào về bản thân (ngày 313)">self-esteem</u>, because while I was doing the blog, I noticed how many people had problems similar to mine – acne and stuff like that. It wasn’t a big deal, it was me who was afraid and ashamed of myself. And it lead me to do some bad stuff, I mean, I was trying to get some revenge instead of just being normal. Well, at least it was exciting! Like this story if you found it interesting and, well, think that I deserved what happened to me in the end. And don’t forget to subscribe!</p>
