      <p>Hi guys! I hope you’re doing well. I’m Angelina and today I’m in the U.S.A. <mark>More precisely</mark>, Chicago or the Windy City as it’s also called. This is the 3rd largest city in the United States after L.A. and New York and there are about 10 million people living in metro Chicago, which they also call Chicagoland.</p>
      <p>Today, I’m in Millennium Park and this is right in the city centre. The Millennium Park took six years to complete. It was built on an area of <mark>railyards</mark> and parking lots.</p>
      <p>This is the main attraction of the park and we’re coming up to it right now. It’s called Cloud Gate. It looks beautiful.</p>
      <p>So, Cloud Gate is its actual name, but can you guess what its nickname is? It’s “The Bean” because it looks like a giant bean, you see?</p>
      <p>This sculpture is actually the result of a big competition. The winner was Anish Kapoor. He’s a British artist and he won. The <u title="ngày 75">budget</u> was 6 million dollars, but it <u title="ngày 118">ended up</u> costing 23 million dollars. How crazy is that? That’s a lot of money. A good thing is that all the money came from <mark>donations</mark>.</p>
      <p>This is “The Bean”! It’s really shiny and you can definitely see your <mark>reflection</mark> in it. I can see a lot of people taking selfies and pictures. It’s a lot bigger than I had imagined coming up to it. Now you can see it up close and it’s super big.</p>
      <p>It feels a little bit scary here. It makes you feel <mark>slightly</mark> <mark>dizzy</mark>, but it’s so cool. You can see the reflection of everyone here. I like it a lot. It’s super cool.</p>
      <p>This is the Crown Fountain. This is a place where people love to come to in the summer to cool off. There’s actually water coming out of the mouth right there. There are faces of people on the wall and the faces change <mark>every now and again</mark>.</p>
      <p>There’s a wall on this side, but on the other side, there’s another wall that’s <mark>identical</mark> to this one, but it shows different faces. They’re kind of facing each other.</p>
      <p>I’ve heard that the faces on these walls are of actual locals that live here in Chicago who have agreed to have their faces put up on the walls, so that’s pretty cool. Wouldn’t that be something?</p>
      <p>The reason this park is called <mark>Millennium</mark> Park is because it was supposed to be finished in the <mark>millennium</mark>, the year 2000, but it was delayed and ended up opening in 2004.</p>
      <p>The location of the park couldn’t be better. Personally, I think they really succeeded in making it fun and interesting for everyone. There are so many different things to see and lots of greenery, so it is perfect. Over here we have something that looks like a wishing well. I have to take the opportunity to make a wish, so I’m going to throw a coin.</p>
      <p>Success!</p>
      <p>This here is called the Jay Pritzker Pavilion and it is the centre piece of the Millennium Park. It hosts a variety of different events. You’ve got concerts, operas, art events, and you can even do yoga here, which is pretty nice.</p>
      <p>The pavilion can fit 11,000 people. Over there you have the 4,000 seats and then this whole grass lawn can fit 7,000 people. This construction is designed to have the same sound acoustics as an indoor concert hall. It must be super fun to go to a concert here.</p>
      <p>Right next to the pavilion is the BP Bridge. It takes you over to the Maggie Daley Park. This bridge is really <mark>gorgeous</mark> because you have trees on both sides, so it just feels like you’re not in the big city. It almost feels like you’re out in the countryside, but when you look up you see the <mark>skyscrapers</mark> and the clouds. It reminds you that you’re in Chicago.</p>
      <p>That bridge had some amazing views. Over here you have a variety of things to do. There’s a climbing wall, mini golf, and my favorite thing, which are the slides. Let’s go ride the slide!</p>
      <p>What an amazing park this is. I’ve had a really fun time today and seeing the music pavilion was really something. I would love to go to a concert there. I want to know, what is your favourite music concert that you’ve ever been to? Please comment below. The best answer is going to win this amazing Chicago tumbler. In the next episode, I’m going to see some more skyscrapers of Chicago, so don’t miss that. See you then. Bye!</p>
