      <p>Hi guys! How are you? I’m still in Toronto and today I’m going on a trip down south. About an hour and a half from here, you’ll find the great Niagara Falls and I’m so excited to see them.</p>
      <p>Guys, we’re here! This is Niagara Falls. Amazing, huh? We are standing on the Canadian side right now and <u title="ngày 155">over there</u> is the American side. We have the border over on that side and it’s actually quite <mark>neat</mark> because there’s a Canadian <mark>flag</mark> and an American flag to <mark>symbolize</mark> that it’s right in between the two countries. I kind of like that.</p>
      <p>Did you know that this is actually quite a popular <u title="(n) a particular place (ngày 83)">spot</u> for <mark>honeymooners</mark>? It became super popular in 1953 after the <u title="ngày 114">release</u> of the movie Niagara with Marilyn Monroe. So, a lot of honeymooners come here. But it’s not just them. It’s also families, kids, couples - anyone can come here. It’s quite touristy, but so nice.</p>
      <p>There are three falls here. There’s the Bridal Veil Fall, which is the smaller one. We have the American Fall <u title="ngày 155">over there</u>. And <u title="ngày 155">over there</u> is the Canadian side and the big Horseshoe Fall. It’s called the Horseshoe Fall because it’s kind of shaped like a <mark>horseshoe</mark>. It actually drops down 57 metres and it’s 790 metres wide, which is huge.</p>
      <p>I’ve seen that they have some really <mark>neat</mark> boats down there going into the falls and I just have to do that. Let’s go do it.</p>
      <p>One of the boats is coming in right now. It looks like there are several boats, so you can just <mark>hop</mark> on <mark>whichever</mark> comes first.</p>
      <p>It looks like people are wearing some kind of a <mark>poncho</mark>, so hopefully I’ll get one of those too because I don’t want to get <u title="ngày 45">soaked</u>.</p>
      <p>We’ll wait in line. It looks like it’s moving pretty fast, so it shouldn’t be too bad.</p>
      <p>I’ve got my ticket. Now, it’s time to get the raincoat.</p>
      <p>Hi. How are you? Thank you. Thank you so much!</p>
      <p>Time to put this on. Alright! I don’t actually know how to do this. Oh, here we go. How do I look? Perfect, right?</p>
      <p>They’re emptying the boat right now, so it’s time to get on. It’s getting real guys. This is it. I’m getting on. This is it.</p>
      <p>I’m on the boat. It actually doesn’t feel that bad. I thought I was going to be more nervous than I actually am, so right now it feels good. And the view is great, so I’m not even thinking about getting scared right now.</p>
      <p>I’m getting a little wet! It’s really <mark>misty</mark> here. Here we go. Much better.</p>
      <p>Yay!</p>
      <p>Wow. It’s actually a lot more misty and windy than I thought it was going to be. I’m glad I have my poncho which is keeping me <u title="more than a little but not very (ngày 95)">somewhat</u> dry.</p>
      <p>This is the American side of the falls. I don’t know if you can see, but there are a few people standing <u title="ngày 155">up there</u>. They’re getting a really good view from up there, but I think we’re getting the best view from the boat because we get to see everything. This is so much cooler.</p>
      <p>We’re getting really close to the falls now. It’s windy and really misty! It’s like we’re going straight into the falls. Wow! This is one of the coolest things I’ve ever done.</p>
      <p>I had no idea we were going to go so close. I thought we were going to stay up there, but we’re actually inside the falls. If you look that way, you can’t see anything. It’s just <mark>mist</mark> and white <mark>foam</mark>. That’s it.</p>
      <p>You can’t even see the sky. I’ve never seen anything like it and I don’t think ever I will again. I’m officially <u title="ngày 160">splashed</u>!</p>
      <p>We’re on our way back now. We were just basically inside the falls and now we’re passing the American falls again on this side. It’s getting a little windy. It’s getting really windy. It’s a nice <u title="ngày 161">breeze</u>. It feels nice. It’s not cold, so I don’t mind.</p>
      <p>I’m <mark>dripping</mark>. I’m so soaked, but it was 100% worth it. I can’t even tell you how much worth it. It was just incredible. <u title="Exclamations with WHAT">What an experience</u>.</p>
      <p>What an amazing time I’ve had here in Niagara Falls. Nature is so cool. I actually have a question for you for a chance to win this really cool Niagara Falls, Canada book. The question is, “What is the coolest nature experience you have ever had?” Please comment below for a chance to win this, and in the next episode, I’m going to show you some more of Toronto. Don’t miss that. Bye bye!</p>
