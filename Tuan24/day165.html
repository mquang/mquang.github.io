      <p>Hi guys! I’m still in Toronto and today I’m going to discover the <mark>Distillery</mark> District. This district is full of art, <mark>hip</mark> people, cool restaurants and shops, and the theme of the art here is love!</p>
      <p>All of these big houses behind me used to be a large whiskey <mark>distillery</mark>, but nowadays, it’s home to hip restaurants, cool bars and boutiques. It’s also a place for art lovers because there are many great <mark>outdoor</mark> sculptures, galleries and theatres around the area. In December, they host the annual Toronto Christmas Market here.</p>
      <p>I spotted my first large outdoor sculpture, so let’s go check it out.</p>
      <p>It kind of looks like something from out of space. I guess it could be a giant <mark>pacifier</mark>, at least this part. I don’t think you can climb this. It doesn’t look like it’<u title="ngày 113">s meant for</u> climbing, but maybe it’s a large playground. Who knows?</p>
      <p>Okay. The sign actually says “do not climb,” so we know it’s not a playground. It’s a <mark>monument</mark> or a sculpture rather.</p>
      <p>There’s supposed to be some kind of a love theme going on with the sculptures, but I can’t really see the love in this thing.</p>
      <p>I mean, it’s really cool, but I don’t really get the theme. Maybe we’ll find some more sculptures that are more love-y.</p>
      <p>I like this t-shirt. It says “poutine.” The picture is actually of poutine, which is a Canadian traditional dish, I guess you could say, or something that you eat a lot here in Canada. It is French fries, gravy and cheese curds. It might sound a little strange, but it’s actually really tasty. I like it.</p>
      <p>Oh look! Some more street art. Now I can definitely see the love theme. Let’s check it out.</p>
      <p>I think they’re getting married or maybe they just got married. I hope they get some good pictures. Beautiful!</p>
      <p>Let’s check out the art. So, we have one big heart with all these different types of locks. I think this is a love symbol, kind of locking in your love with each other. This is really <u title="cool (ngày 163)">neat</u> - and very romantic. There are all these different locks that people have written their names on. Some of them just have the initials on them.</p>
      <p>We have the big heart right here and then the letters “love” spelled L-O-V-E. That’s really nice!</p>
      <p>I know this guy. Can you guess who it is? It’s John Lennon.</p>
      <p>It’s so nice to walk around here, window shop, look at the different art works and pieces. I feel like in every window, you find something new. It’s so colourful!</p>
      <p>Look! It’s a huge peace sign. Peace and Love. It has all these different symbols from different religions, I think.</p>
      <p>I like this. This definitely goes with the theme of love.</p>
      <p><mark>Speaking of art</mark>, I found this really interesting art gallery I want to check out. Come on.</p>
      <p>Here’s another huge sculpture. I actually know this one. It’s called I.T. by the artist Michael Christian and it looks like a giant spider. It has the little red thing up there, which I guess could be the heart. Heart … love … I totally get the theme there.</p>
      <p>However, it kind of looks scary, especially when you’re standing <u title="">right</u> <mark>underneath</mark> it. It’s like, hello! It’s a giant spider!</p>
      <p>This is a cool store! It kind of looks like a <u title="">warehouse</u>. I want to see what it looks like on the inside. It smells so good in here. This is my favourite skin care <mark>brand</mark>.</p>
      <p>Face cleanser, some serums…. Wow.</p>
      <p>Thank you so much!</p>
      <p>Today has been really fun, but I’m starting to get super hungry, so I’m going to head inside and grab something really Canadian.</p>
      <p>Let’s see. I’m looking for some <mark>waffles</mark> with <mark>maple</mark> <mark>syrup</mark>. They do have waffles and if there are waffles, I’m sure they have maple syrup.</p>
      <p>The maple leaf is really important to the Canadians. You can see it on the Canadian flag, among other things. It’s definitely a <mark>staple</mark> here in Canada. Maple syrup is a must.</p>
      <p>Thank you so much. I need to take a picture of it. I’m just going to take a quick picture of this for me. There you go.</p>
      <p>Oh my goodness. How amazing does this look?</p>
      <p>First of all, and most important, is the maple syrup. Let’s <mark>drizzle</mark> that on. Yes! Wow. Oh, this looks amazing.</p>
      <p>I’m going to try it first with just the maple syrup because it’s the best part. Here we go. A nice big bite with lots of syrup.</p>
      <p>This proves that we’re really in Canada. Apparently, for being a <mark>sweet treat</mark>, maple syrup isn’t even that unhealthy. You get full of antioxidants and other nutrients, so it’s not really that bad for you.</p>
      <p>You can put it on waffles or pancakes, if you prefer pancakes. That’s also really delicious, but I’m a waffle girl.</p>
      <p>Today is my last day here in Canada, but I’ve had so much fun.</p>
      <p>Today I’ve seen some really great artwork. I want to know, what is your favourite piece of artwork that you’ve seen? Please comment below for the chance to win this very Canadian <u title="">mug</u> and don’t forget to watch the next episode. Bye!</p>
