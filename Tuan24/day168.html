      <p>Hi everybody! I’m still in Chicago. I don’t know if you know this, but Chicago is the birth place of the skyscraper and <u title="ngày 129">considered</u> the most <u title="ngày 7">influential</u> <u title="ngày 68">architectural</u> city of the 20th century. So <u title="ngày 108">apart from</u> all these tall buildings, there’s the Chicago River running through the city. I thought that today, we would mix a little bit of both. Let’s go on the architecture <mark>river cruise</mark>.</p>
      <p>I’m on the boat now. The tour has started and, of course, I want to be in the front. Let’s go to the front of the boat. This has the best view. I think we’re going to see a lot of great buildings on this tour. I’m super excited to learn more about when they were built and what they were built for and things like that, so I’m excited.</p>
      <p>That breeze feels lovely. I really like that there’s a huge <u title="ngày 72">variety</u> of skyscrapers. You have lots of buildings that look a lot older, and then you have the all glass ones that look super modern. You get a mix of both which makes the city really interesting.</p>
      <p>These are so lovely. I think these are <u title="ngày 26">residential</u> buildings and houses where people live. They also have really nice balconies facing the water. These buildings were actually built on a <u title="ngày 153">dump</u> in 2000.</p>
      <p>Look what they did to the place. That’s amazing.</p>
      <p>Hey! They’re <mark>waving</mark> at me. Hi! Everyone is so nice here. I love it.</p>
      <p>Here you can see some more of the residential building. What’s cool about this building is that it feels like it’s right on the water. At the window, when you look down, there’s nothing but water. There’s no street or anything. It’s <mark>literally</mark> on the water. It’s very cool.</p>
      <p>In 1871, there was a huge fire here in Chicago that destroyed 9 square kilometres of the city and 100,000 people were left homeless. Because of that, they had to rebuild all the buildings and houses. They started building really tall buildings and that is why Chicago is the birth place of the skyscrapers. Actually, the skyline is among the tallest, <mark>densest</mark> skylines in the entire world.</p>
      <p>This is such a <u title="ngày 155">majestic</u> feeling! We’re about to go under the bridge this way, so we’re <mark>literally</mark> going between all the skyscrapers. Wow. They have some tall buildings here!</p>
      <p>This building is cool. This one is basically all glass. I have no idea how they build that. That’s a <u title="ngày 124">mystery</u> to me, how they do that. I can’t even imagine, but it looks beautiful.</p>
      <p>This tallest building right here is called the Willis Tower. It used to be called the Sears Tower and was the tallest building in the world between 1973 and 1998 until the Petronas Towers <u title="ngày 157">took over</u> and became the tallest building.</p>
      <p>That’s such a <mark>cozy</mark> place. I love places like that. You can find so many restaurants and cafés that are right on the water where you can just sit and have some food and enjoy the view. That has to be the best way to have lunch, right?</p>
      <p>I’ve seen so many of these water taxis here on the river. I just think that the idea of them is great because not only can you get to a place faster because there’s a lot of traffic and going in an actual taxi takes longer, but it’s also so much more environmentally friendly. Thumbs up for Chicago for doing that. I love that.</p>
      <p>That building right there, that looks kind of <mark>wavy</mark>, is called the Aqua Building.</p>
      <p>This one’s called the Vista and they are the tallest buildings in the world designed by a female architect, so I love that.</p>
      <p>We’re coming out towards the <mark>harbor</mark> right now. If you go straight out there, that’s Lake Michigan. Over on the left side here, there’s something called the Navy <u title="ngày 158">Pier</u>, which looks really fun. It has a big Ferris wheel, there are lots of rides you can go on, and you can hang out and have lots of fun.</p>
      <p>Right next to downtown, you’ve got this huge beach over there where you can go swimming in the summertime or <mark>go boating</mark>. There’s lots of fun stuff to do over there.</p>
      <p>I feel like I’m flying.</p> 
      <p>The boat tour is over. I can’t believe it’s finished already. It felt like it was only 10 minutes long and I would have loved to stay on even longer because I had the most amazing time. But it’s time to get off.</p>
      <p>I decided to take a walk here along the river. It’s actually really nice and you get a great view from here. The City of Chicago built this <mark>walkway</mark> in 2001 and it’s the perfect way to get away from the traffic and all the people, and just walk in peace.</p>
      <p>I like this part of the river walk. This looks really cozy with all the lights. This area is super fun. You can play some games here.</p>
      <p>They have the nice lights over here as well. There are some games over here. There’s a little restaurant and bar where you can order something to eat and drink. It also has the perfect location right by the water.</p>
      <p>It’s nice to be able to hang out here by the river and just relax. Even though Lake Michigan is over there and you have that big beach, sometimes you want to just sit down and have a drink, and this is the perfect spot for that.</p>
      <p>Today has been really amazing and I loved seeing all the buildings here in Chicago. I think it’s a beautiful city. I want to know, which is the most beautiful city that you know and why? Please comment below. The winner is going to get this Chicago pencil case. In the next episode, I’m going to visit the <u title="ngày 164">hip</u> area Wicker Park here in Chicago. I’ll see you then. Bye!</p>
