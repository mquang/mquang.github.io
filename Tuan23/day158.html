      <p>Hi and welcome back to On the go with EF.
I hope everybody’s doing really well. I’m in Santa Barbara, which is a small beach
town on the west coast of the United States. Today, I’m going to explore the beach area by bike.</p>
      <p>I’m going along the beachway right now. 
Wow! So many boats! Well, I can see why because
Santa Barbara is absolutely beautiful. If I had a boat, I would definitely come here.</p>
      <p>They’re all different sizes.
Some people have huge boats out here. I’m so happy I rented a bike.
I can definitely recommend it.
</p>
      <p>You know, Santa Barbara is known to be the 
American Riviera - and I can really see why. You’ve got the ocean, the sunshine… The vibe is just so laid back.
It feels like you’re on vacation. Apparently, there are about
90,000 people living here, but honestly, <mark>you could never
tell</mark> because it’s so empty. There’s so much empty space.
You still see a lot of people and there are quite a lot of tourists here,
but it doesn’t feel crowded.
</p>
      <p>It’s beautiful and I love
the smell of the ocean.
</p>
      <p>Oh, look! There’s a <mark>pier</mark>!
This is such a nice bike ride. I’m really enjoying the palm
trees and the blue skies. And I quite like people watching, too.
</p>
      <p>It’s fun to see what people <mark>are up to</mark> when they go to the beach. I’m coming up to the pier.
I’m so excited to explore it. It looks really fun.</p>
      <p>Okay. There we go. Let’s go to the pier!</p>
      <p><mark>Pelicans</mark>, I think. It looks like it.
They’re big birds, anyway. I wonder if there are a lot of fish here.</p>
      <p>This is called Stearns Warf.
The people are super laid back. A lot of people are just walking
in their shorts and t-shirts. Nobody’s really <mark>dressed up</mark>. It’s super casual.</p>
      <p>There’s a fish and chips shop. It’s quite cool. I like the vibe of having a fish
and chips shop on the pier. Then, you can walk all the way out and
I bet there’s a nice lookout spot out there.</p>
      <p>This is the end of the pier
and wow, it’s beautiful.</p>
      <p>This view is incredible, too.
Over there is Santa Barbara. And these are the Santa Ynez Mountains. I’m so happy I walked all the way out here.
It was definitely worth it.
</p>
      <p>The pier was really nice, but now I’m
ready to hang out here at the beach. Let’s go get some snacks.
</p>
<p>I got them. Let’s go to the beach!</p>
<p>Yes, the perfect spot.
I’ve got some strawberries and some chocolate.</p>
<p>I’m going to take my shoes off….
I’m going to have a strawberry.</p>
<p>Mmmm. That’s really sweet.</p>
<p>Santa Barbara really is a <mark>year-round</mark> tourist destination and it’s famous for its amazing weather,
its downtown beaches and its Spanish architecture. If you saw me last week, I was in town and you could really see how the buildings
have been influenced by the Spanish. So, that’s pretty cool. Also, this beach is really
close to the town centre. It’s only about a 10 minute walk. The perfect way to end a day.</p>
<p>I’ve had a really great time today.
I got to explore pier, I rented a bike, and I went all along the beach,
which was <mark>fabulous</mark>. Now, I bought this really cute <mark>mug</mark>.
It’s a Santa Barbara mug. I like it and wish I could
keep it myself, but I can’t because I’m going to give it 
away to one of you guys. Please answer the question:
What is your favorite snack to bring to the beach? Comment below for a chance to win this - and that’s it for me today. See you!</p>
