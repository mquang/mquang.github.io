      <p>Hi everybody! Last week you could see me exploring <mark>Hollywood Boulevard</mark>. Today, I’m going to visit another famous place related to the movies. I’m going to Universal Studios.</p>

      <p>Guys, I’m inside the park and I know that they have something here called the Harry Potter World. And for me, who absolutely loved the books and the movies, this is going to be so exciting.</p>

      <p>I don’t even know where to start looking. There is so much to look at. Look at these buildings! Everything is so detailed. It looks like a real small town.</p>

      <p>Oh, there’s Despicable Me, Minion Mayhem. But I really want to find Harry Potter World! I think we should go this way.</p>

      <p>Oooh. Fun Land!</p>

      <p>They’re wearing Harry Potter clothes. I feel like I’m getting closer now. That’s so cool!</p>

      <p>I see it! It’s the Hogwart’s Castle! It looks just like in the movies.</p>

      <p>Oh my goodness. They even have snow on the roof.</p>

      <p>This is a dream come true for me, truly, being the biggest Harry Potter fan that I am.</p>

      <p>I see the entrance. The sign says “Please Respect The Spell Limits.”</p>

      <p>We’re about to enter Harry Potter World.</p>

      <p>Look!. It’s the Hogwarts Express. That’s the train that all the Hogwarts students arrive on.</p>

      <p>I need to take a picture.</p>

      <p>I got some good ones. Wow. Let’s see what else they have.</p>

      <p>There are so many people wearing Harry Potter costumes.</p>

      <p>I wish I had one. I would totally wear it. I know it’s a little <mark>nerdy</mark>, but I would.</p>

      <p>They have butterbeer! It’s a <mark>typical</mark> Harry Potter drink.</p>

      <p>It’s not actual beer but I think I’m going to try some. Yeah, I’m definitely going to try some.</p>

      <p>Hi!</p>

      <p>Ok, let me get out of the way.</p>

      <p>This is the moment I’ve been waiting for ever since I first read the Harry Potter books. Here we go. Mmmm. It’s so good. It tastes like vanilla. It’s really sweet. I don’t know what I imagined. I’m drinking butterbeer in Hogsmeade! It’s so cool. This is probably one of the coolest things I’ve ever done in my life.</p>

      <p>I can’t believe I got to experience the World of Harry Potter. This is one of the coolest things I’ve ever done in my life. Incredible! I want to see some more of the park because there’s so much to do here, so let’s go and check out some more stuff.</p>

      <p>We’re entering Springfield from the Simpsons. There’s a huge <mark>donut</mark>.</p>

      <p>Krusty Land! That’s from the show.</p>

      <p>Just hanging with my friend. It looks delicious. I want to eat it.</p>

      <p>So now I’m about to go on the studio tour. The L.A. <mark>studio lot</mark> opened for the public in 1915 and became a theme park in 1964.</p>

      <p>The studio tour takes you around the different <mark>lots</mark> where they shoot both T.V. shows and movies.</p>

      <p>OK. Let’s go!</p>

      <p>It’s so cool to see all of these buildings because for every movie that they shoot, they change the <mark>exterior</mark> so it can look like any street in any city in the world.</p>

      <p>Uh oh! We’re going to Mexico!</p>

      <p>Uh oh! There’s a <mark>thunder</mark> storm coming in here. Here comes the water.</p>

      <p>That’s crazy. I wonder how much water they have to refill every time they do that.</p>

      <p>I don’t want to get eaten by a shark. There he is! I got <mark>splashed</mark> again. That was the shark in Jaws.</p>

      <p>End of the tour. Yay!</p>

      <p>It’s been fun. Wow, that was incredible.</p>

      <p>Guys, I’ve <mark>truly</mark> enjoyed myself today. The highlight of the day was definitely visiting Harry Potter World because I am the hugest fan of the books and the movies are my favorite movies. I want to know, what is your favorite movie? The best answer will win this really cool Hollywood sign. So comment below and I will see you next time. Bye!</p>
