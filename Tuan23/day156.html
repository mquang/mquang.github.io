      <p>Hi everyone! Today, I’m on the island of Coronado, which is an island just outside of San Diego. You can go here by car going over a bridge, overlooking the water and <mark>skyline</mark>. It’s absolutely beautiful. Or, you can take a boat. And look at this beach! It’s incredible!</p>
      <p>Wow, it’s really hot today. I wish I’d brought my bathing suit!</p>
      <p>Oh, this is the Hotel del Coronado. I don’t know if you recognize it, but you might. It was in the 1959 Billy Wilder movie called "Some Like it Hot" starring Marilyn Monroe. They <mark>shot</mark> a lot of the <mark>scenes</mark> here on the beach and they actually shot some at the hotel as well. The hotel was built in 1888 and it is the second largest wooden structure in the United States. In the 1920s, it was the <mark>playground</mark> for all the Hollywood <mark>celebrities</mark>. They would come down here to San Diego to party and drink and have a good time. Today, it’s still a really big hotel and resort and a lot of people come here, celebrities as well.</p>
      <p>Wow, it really is beautiful here. It’s a really nice place if you just want to come here and walk around. It must be incredible to live in the hotel and be able to overlook the ocean. The view!</p>
      <p>They even have a beach bar. If I were to stay at this hotel, I would probably choose one of these little beach villas. How nice would it be to wake up in the morning and be able to go out on your balcony, <mark>take a deep breath</mark> and <mark>breathe in</mark> the ocean air. I wouldn’t mind doing that every day.</p>
      <p>You know, guys, it’s really fun being in the sun, but it can also get pretty <mark>exhausting</mark>. I’m super-hot right now, so I know just what to get because I’m <u title="">melting away</u>.</p>
      <p>Ta-da! Ice cream, of course. This is probably the biggest ice cream I’ve ever had. Let’s see if it tastes good. </p>
      <p>Ready?  Mmmm. That’s really good. Wow. Chocolate ice cream, whipped cream, bananas …. Dreamy. Perfect on a hot day.</p>
      <p>Wow. That ice cream was really something. This is the city centre of Coronado with a population of around 25,000. Coronado is actually Spanish and it means “the crowned one”, so the city’s nickname now is The Crowned City.</p>
      <p>This is the main shopping street, so you have all the shops, coffee places, restaurants … everything you need.</p>
      <p>This one’s nice! I like the colors. Very beachy.</p>
      <p>I wonder if you can rent these bicycles or just purchase them. I notice that a lot of people actually ride bicycles around here. It’s perfect because you’re on the island, so why take a car when you can take a bicycle?</p>
      <p>These look like … oh, they’re e-bike rentals. You can actually rent these. I guess they have a motor on them, so you don’t have to … </p>
      <p>You can get acai bowls. Lots of people eat acai bowls in California.</p>
      <p>Oh, look! Postcards! Let’s see this one. I guess this is the <mark>waterfront</mark> of San Diego. They have a lot of different ones. Oh, here’s one of Coronado. That’s the hotel. Hotel del Coronado, that’s what it’s called.</p>
      <p>And then, obviously, the <mark>flag</mark> of California. You see that one everywhere.</p>
      <p>I just love it when you can walk down the street and you have all these beautiful trees, like the palm trees. It just looks nice – so inviting, I think. Especially now, that the sun is shining, it’s just beautiful.</p>
      <p>I’ve had a really fun day here in Coronado. I got to spend time on the beach, enjoy the sun, and I had a really amazing ice cream. Now, I want to know, what is your favorite ice cream flavor? Comment below and you can win this super cute coin purse with a <mark>surfer</mark> and the sunset on it. Don’t forget to watch next week. See you!</p>
