      <p>Hi everyone and welcome back to “On the go with EF”. I’m still here in San Diego,
but today is actually my last day here. Something a lot of people do when they
go to California is to go on a road trip, and I’m going to do just that.
I’m driving to Santa Barbara.</p>
      <p>I’m in the car right now driving to Santa Barbara. It’s about a 4-hour drive from
San Diego to Santa Barbara. I’m on the PCH right now,
which is the <mark>Pacific</mark> <mark>Coast</mark> Highway. It goes all the way along the <mark>coast</mark>, so you
go through Malibu and you pass LA as well.</p>
      <p>It’s an absolutely beautiful drive. The houses around here are amazing
and they’re so much fun to look at. Then you have the ocean, the palm trees, the sun.
It’s just an <mark>incredible</mark> drive.
</p>
      <p>If you have the time, I would definitely recommend
driving all the way up to San Francisco because it’s also a beautiful drive. It’s much longer, but you can take the 405,
which is more <mark>inland</mark> and a little bit faster. But, if you want to enjoy the beautiful scenery, 
I would definitely say, take the PCH.
</p>
      <p>Right now, I think we’re coming up to Zuma Beach, which I’ve heard is one of the most
beautiful beaches around here. It’s a beautiful, sunny day, like pretty
much every day here in California, so I can definitely see why
people are at the beach.
</p>
      <p>I’m finally in Santa Barbara!
It’s absolutely beautiful here. I can’t wait to explore the city.

</p>
      <p>I’m here! Wow, it’s so warm today. I’m so excited to be here
in Santa Barbara, finally. The drive was beautiful. Driving on the Pacific Coast Highway
was absolutely amazing, but I’m so excited to be here
and check out the city!</p>
      <p>I really like these buildings and
the little balconies up there. It looks really <mark>exotic</mark>.
The buildings are just incredible.
</p>
      <p>Actually, Santa Barbara used to be Spanish. In the 18th century, the Spanish
<mark>missionaries</mark> and soldiers settled here. So, you can see a lot of the influence
from the Spanish era in the buildings. A lot of the buildings are Spanish.
Even Mexicans were here. The Mexicans stayed here in
Santa Barbara for 24 years until 1846 when it was <mark>taken over</mark> by the Americans
and made part of the United States.
</p>
      <p>It’s really cool to see the mixture of the
American buildings and the Spanish influence, so it’s really a mix of both. It’s really cool!
I’ve never been to a place like this.</p>
      <p>I’ve heard that a lot of the street
signs reflect the Mexican <mark>era</mark>. That seems to be one of them.
Anacapa. Right?
</p>
      <p>This one’s really cool. It’s soft, too. I really like the <mark>vibe</mark> here in Santa Barbara. It’s super <mark>casual</mark>, the people are really
<mark>laid back</mark>, and the weather’s great, so I think I’m going to really enjoy it here.</p>
      <p>What an amazing road trip I’ve been on today.
Driving up here from San Diego was so beautiful and from what I’ve seen of
Santa Barbara, I really like it so far.
</p>
      <p>Today’s question is: what is your
favorite road that you’ve been on? Comment below and the most
interesting answer will get this bag. It’s really cute. It has a car on it.
It says Santa Barbara and <mark>Pacific Ocean</mark>. Don’t forget to watch next week because
I’ll be going to the beach here in Santa Barbara. See you then!
