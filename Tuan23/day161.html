      <p>Hi everyone! California, and especially L.A., is all about staying fit and being healthy. So, to feel like a true L.A.er, I’m going to go hiking. On the way, I’m going to see the Hollywood sign and the Hollywood Hills.</p>
      <p>Here in Hollywood, there’s this big mountain called the Runyon Canyon. It is super popular among L.A.ers to come here and get their workout in. Especially during the weekends, it’s really popular. I’ve heard that this trail is called the <mark>Suicide</mark> Trail, so this is the one I’m going to take. Let’s hope I make it.</p>
      <p>The view of the mountain and everything … you can see some <mark>cactuses</mark> <u title="ngày 155">up there</u>. It’s a really hot day because the sun is out, as always. But there’s a nice <mark>breeze</mark> once you get further up the mountain, so it doesn’t feel too hot.</p>
      <p>It feels pretty nice. Look at this! I didn’t realize how far up I was already. This view is incredible. Let’s go closer.</p>
      <p>This is L.A. You can see downtown all the way <u title="ngày 155">over there</u>. <u title="ngày 155">Down here</u> is Hollywood and, over there, you have the Santa Monica area, and Venice as well. I’m just taking it all in. I feel really <u title="ngày 160">Zen</u> <u title="ngày 155">up here</u>. I feel really relaxed. Beautiful.</p>
      <p>Once you’re <u title="ngày 155">up here</u> and you can really get a full view of the city, you realize how big it is. It’s absolutely huge! It <mark>stretches</mark> from all the way <u title="ngày 155">over there</u> to all the way <u title="ngày 155">over here</u>. Pretty <mark>spectacular</mark>.</p>
      <p>I guess this is the way up and now I can understand why they call it the suicide trail. It looks really hard. Let’s go! It’s <mark>steep</mark>.</p>
      <p>Wow, this is steep.</p>
      <p>My legs are burning right now. This is so much harder than I thought it would be, but it’s fun. With this view, this is the best workout.</p>
      <p>Cool! I’ve seen people do this on bridges. I think it means that when you lock the lock, you kind of lock in your love between two people. I guess it’s a sign of love, a romantic <mark>gesture</mark>. A lot of them have names on them. It’s kind of pretty, actually.</p>
      <p>Oh, and shoes! I don’t really know what all these shoes <mark>stand for</mark>. Maybe somebody took the hike and just got tired half way, and just left their shoes <u title="ngày 155">up here</u>. I don’t know.</p>
      <p>Oh, here’s the Hollywood sign! The famous Hollywood sign. It looks a lot smaller from over here, but I think if you’re up close, the letters must be quite big. The area <u title="ngày 155">down here</u> below the sign is called Hollywood Hills. It’s really famous because a lot of celebrities and well known people actually live here. The houses are beautiful. They have a lot of big <mark>mansions</mark> down here, so if you take your car or walk around the Hollywood Hills, you can see some amazing houses. I would love to have a house here.</p>
      <p>I finally <mark>made it to</mark> the top. There’s another top over there, but this is the top right here. I can sit down for a second. I’m <mark>exhausted</mark>, but I feel really good.</p>
      <p>Time for me to keep going. This trail is actually a great place for celebrity spotting. A lot of celebrities come here to hike, so if you’re here, you might see one or two.</p>
      <p>It looks like it’s downhill from here. That feels nice. I would be lying if I said I didn’t appreciate it.</p>
      <p>I made it!</p>
      <p>Today has been great and I feel amazing. I really love working out outdoors. What’s your favorite workout method? Please comment below and I’m going to send this super cool I Love L.A. water bottle to the one with the <mark>wittiest</mark> answer. Sadly, this was my last episode, but thank you so much for watching. Next week, Maria is going to visit Dublin, so don’t miss that. Bye!</p>
