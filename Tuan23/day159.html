      <p>Hi everyone! Guess where I am right now. I’m in Hollywood, Los Angeles! It’s just two and a half hours from EF San Diego, and I’m going to show you some of the most <mark>well-known</mark> spots.</p>
      <p>Right now, I’m on Hollywood Blvd, which you’ve probably seen on TV or at least heard of. It’s a long street with all of these iconic palm trees and, in the street, you can actually find these stars. These stars have the names of celebrities, artists, and actors who <u title="ngày 59">have been awarded</u> with a star in the street. Let’s see what we can find.</p>
      <p>I think we have a cool one here. Here’s Tom Hanks. We also have Donna Summer. What else? Ooh. Liza Minnelli.</p>
      <p>I don’t really know who all these people are, but it’s so cool to see all the different names.</p>
      <p>I would really love to find Johnny Depp’s star, if he has one, because he’s my favorite actor of all time.</p>
      <p>What’s this? Joyce Compton, and some people I don’t really know.</p>
      <p>I found it! I found the star of Johnny Depp. I love this. This is so cool. I didn’t know he actually had a star.</p>
      <p>I know this is a little bit <u title="ngày 107">silly</u>, but I have to take a picture with the star. Just one.</p>
      <p>Cute.</p>
      <p>My favorite Johnny Depp movie is Sleepy Hollow. If you haven’t seen it, I recommend it. I’m so glad I found it!</p>
      <p>Here’s the really famous Chinese Theatre. The building is really cool. It really <u title="ngày 140">stands out</u> here in Hollywood because, obviously, it’s Chinese inspired. This theatre opened in 1927 with Cecil B. DeMille’s film, The King of Kings. Since then, it has <mark>hosted</mark> many <mark>premieres</mark>. In 1977, they hosted the Star Wars premiere here.</p>
      <p>Actually, what I think it’s most famous for, are the footprints. There are over 200 footprints and handprints of movie stars. If you walk around in here, you can see all sorts of people, and big movie stars who have left their hand and footprints here. It’s pretty cool.</p>
      <p>Oh, look! There’s Marilyn Monroe.</p>
      <p>Let’s see. Not the same shoe size.</p>
      <p>How cool would that be to be able to just put your hand print here.</p>
      <p>Right now we’re at the Madame Tussauds, which is a <mark>wax</mark> museum. They have plenty of wax <mark>figures</mark> in there of famous people. People go in there and take pictures with the figures. You can kind of feel like you’ve met the celebrity even though it’s just a wax figure. It’s pretty cool.</p>
      <p>There’s also the El Capitan Theatre, which is across the street. If you love Disney, I really recommend you go there because they show old Disney movies  and new ones as well. It’s on all day, so you can just go by and see a movie, which is pretty nice.</p>
      <p>There are plenty of other museums here as well. There’s the Wax Museum, the Guinness World of Records Museum, and there’s also the Hollywood Museum. I heard they have a pretty cool Marilyn Monroe collection, so if you love her, you should definitely go there.</p>
      <p>You can really tell that Hollywood is the film center of the world because everywhere you look, there are movie theatres, cinemas… everything. I even think they’re shooting a movie here because behind me, there are lots of <mark>equipment</mark> and lots of people. There’s always stuff going on here. They’re definitely shooting a movie. I wonder what they’re shooting.</p>
      <p>There’s security everywhere, too. Exciting!</p>
      <p>Just be aware that when you come here, it gets really <mark>crowded</mark>. There are a lot of tourists, but, if you’re in L.A., you have to see Hollywood. It’s a must.</p>
      <p>It smells like popcorn. I kind of want to go see a movie right now.</p>
      <p>I’ve had a great time here in Hollywood today. I’m so excited that I got to see the star of Johnny Depp. That was really fun. Now I want to know, who is your favorite movie star and why? Comment below and the starriest answer will win this super cool Hollywood sign that says “Entertainment Capital of the World.” Don’t forget to watch next week because I’ll be seeing the Harry Potter World at Universal Studios. See you then. Bye!</p>
