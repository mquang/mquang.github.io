        <p>I'm 25 years old and I'm originally from Venezuela. I came to the United States on July 12 2017. My country is amazing it has beautiful places to visit, lovely climate and beautiful people but me and my family were forced to <u title="bỏ trốn, chạy trốn (ngày 171)">flee</u> to protect ourselves from <u title="cảnh bị tra tấn, hành hạ (ngày 222)">torture</u> and possibly death.</p>

        <p>It all happened because of the <mark>raids</mark> and <u title="các cuộc biểu tình, phản đối (ngày 306)">protests</u> that were happening in my Country at the time which started because even though people have money to get food clothes and basic necessity items, we couldn't find them. We knew so many people have worked in banks, hospitals, schools, who were still found eating out of the trash or putting that food in bags to bring to their families.</p>

        <p>All the pain all the injustice became too much and I was angry. I decided that I had to make a stand against everything that I knew was wrong and against the people that were hurting my Country. You have to understand that the people that were in government positions weren't doing what they <u title="được cho là nên làm/phải làm (ngày 79)">were supposed to</u> which is to protect their <u title="công dân (ngày 26)">citizens</u> and help their country <u title="cố gắng phấn đấu (ngày 238)">strive</u> and grow better.</p>

        <p>That's when I decided to join an <mark>activist</mark> group that would always go out during the protests but I knew that it had to be done if we wanted to see change but it was also very scary because many people died. There was this guy, I really didn't know him, he was part of the cause part of what I had been fighting for. A national guard pointed his tear gas bomb gun at him and he just <u title="bắn, nổ súng (ngày 137)">fired</u>. All I saw was a big <u title="bắn tung tóe (ngày 160)">splash</u> of blood and his eyes, they looked at me while he was falling back feeling how his life was ending. I rested his head on my <u title="lòng (ngày 304)">lap</u> and began to sing a song. From that moment on I sang at every single protest and began to pray at every single speaker wherever people could hear me I would pray and ask God to help us, to protect us.</p>

        <p>So time went on and National Guard officers began to go to the area I lived in. We couldn't sleep because we didn't know what would happen. Maybe they would take us underground and torture us. My mom was very scared and decided she didn't want to <mark>take any chances</mark>. That's when she found a way for me and my brother to get a ticket for us to fly out of the country and go to my relatives house and that's when I filed for <mark>asylum</mark> to become a <u title="dân nhập cư hợp pháp (ngày 181 + 169)">legal immigrant</u> in this country.</p> 

        <p>It's been hard listening to all of these things that are still going on in Venezuela. I pray for my Country every day and hope that everything will go back to the way it <u title="đã từng (ngày 10)">used to</u>. For those who died for those who are still living in <mark>oppression</mark>, for those who are <u title="đấu tranh (ngày 263)">struggling</u> in their position as national guards, I just wanted to let them know that in this fight we're all brothers and sisters from the same nation.</p>

         <p>When I first went on study abroad, I was super excited. Everyone always tells you it is the best experience of your life and you won't want to come home by the time it's over. I was excited to experience this new culture, these new people, and especially the history of where I was staying. So I finally <u title="xuống (máy bay) (ngày 155)">got off</u> my flight, made my way to my <u title="kí túc xá (ngày 326)">dorm</u>, and I remember looking out the window for the first time and just getting this feeling of <u title="nỗi lo sợ (ngày 287)">dread</u>. I was alone in a country I had never been in, I didn't know anybody. I was just thinking, "What have I <u title="We usually say “get yourself into” when we’re talking about a surprising or difficult situation. Something that’s overwhelming. Something that’s more than you thought originally.">gotten myself into</u>?" So I <mark>called my family up</mark> and I said, "To be honest, I don't know if I made the right choice." So my sister called me back and said, "Well, I went on study abroad and I had the same feelings at first. You feel alone, you feel scared, but you'll <u title="thích ứng, thích nghi (ngày 54)">adapt</u> and you'll have a great time."</p> 

        <p>So the first week went on, I met some very nice people, I saw some beautiful sights, but there was almost this <u title="màng che (ngày 114)">veil</u> over my eyes as if I wasn't really experiencing what I was seeing. People would always asks, you know, how's study abroad going, what are you seeing, what are you doing, are you having a good time, and there's such a <u title="áp lực (ngày 326)">pressure</u> on you at study abroad to have this <dfn data-inf="tuyệt vời">fantastic</dfn>, life-changing experience. So I would just kind of smile and <u title="gật đầu (ngày 218)">nod</u>. I would post pictures on social media detailing the places I went, but all of it was really quite <mark>hollow</mark>. I felt extremely lost and like I didn't have a purpose. I wasn't enjoying my classes, I was having trouble making connections, and I overall just was <u title="rất muốn (ngày 117)">desperate</u> to go home.</p> 

        <p>My family had spent so much money on this trip, on my college and the education I was receiving. And I was afraid that going home would make me a failure. So after two and a half months abroad, I reached a point that I think was finally my breaking point. I felt like there was no <u title="lối thoát (ngày 171)">escape</u>, like if I went home I was a failure, but if I stayed I would have to continue to be <u title="khốn khổ, khổ sở (ngày 115)">miserable</u> and alone. So I <mark>called up</mark> my therapist and I told him how I really felt, and this was a point where him and I together decided I needed to go home. This meant I would not receive any of the <u title="tín chỉ (ngày 223)">credits</u> I had worked hard on in my classes, I would have to <mark>retake</mark> this <u title="kì học (ngày 27)">semester</u>. But I was just so desperate to get out of the situation, it didn't matter anymore.</p> 

        <p>So two days later I was on a plane home. I told all my friends I was leaving, I told my flatmates why I had to go, and on social media I made a post saying for health reasons I will be coming home early. So it has been a month since I came home and people will still ask me how my study abroad was, and it's still a very <u title="câu hỏi khó (ngày 195)">tough question</u> for me to answer, because I was a beautiful place and I saw beautiful things I will never forget. But it just wasn't the right time for me to do what I was doing. In the end, I had to figure out that my mental and physical health were what were most important in the situation, and that sometimes what everyone else does is not what you need to do. Do things at your own <u title="tốc độ học tập, làm việc, phát triển (ngày 209)">pace</u> because sometimes your pace is different from what other people expect it to be.</p>
