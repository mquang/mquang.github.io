      <p>Hey guys. My name is Bruce, I'm 25 years old. Recently, I almost <u title="vào tù (ngày 297)">went to jail</u> due to <u title="lời buộc tội sai (ngày 76)">false charges</u>. Worst of all, it was the result of my plan to <u title="trả thù, trả đũa (ngày 181)">take revenge</u> on my two <mark>school bullies</mark>. I just wanted to restore <mark>justice</mark>, but instead, I became a <mark>whipping boy</mark> again.</p>

      <p>It all started with a message in a group chat. It's been exactly 7 years since our graduation from school, and friends were going to arrange a <u title="(n) buổi họp lớp (ngày 234)">reunion</u>. At that moment, my hands started shaking and I started <u title="(v-ing) toát mồ hôi">sweating</u> <mark>profusely</mark>. I <u title="thực sự (ngày 168)">literally</u> had a <u title="(n) cơn hoảng loạn">panic attack</u> when I remembered my classmates. The thing is, I wasn't a popular guy at school. I was the exact opposite. I was the one who was usually pointed at and laughed at.</p>

      <p>Uh, I had a lot of <u title="(ns) những vấn đề về tâm lý (ngày 175)">psychological problems</u> after school that I had to work on a lot with my <u title="(n) bác sĩ chuyên khoa (ngày 220)">therapist</u>. I was very <u title="(adj) tự ti, thiếu tự tin (ngày 66)">insecure</u>, I had <mark>low self-esteem</mark>, and I had <mark>impostor syndrome</mark>. This means that I believed that I was undeserving of everything I achieved, and that it just happened by chance or luck. I can't say that I was successful, but I work in <mark>the IT sphere</mark>, and already at 25 I had my own house and a cool car. But I still couldn't forget the <mark>horrors</mark> of school life.</p>

      <p>I immediately turned to my therapist for help, and we quickly found out what the problem was. Sarah and Jasmine. Oh, I hated them with all my heart. They were the ones that bothered me the most at school. They were "cool" girls, and all the bad things they did to me only added to their respect. One day they took my collection of toy dinosaurs from me and returned them completely ruined. They <u title="(v-ed of tear) xé">tore</u> their heads off and <mark>taped</mark> them to different bodies with <mark>duct tape</mark>. Very funny.</p>

      <p>The worst part was that I liked one of them a lot. Jasmine. I think she felt that I was in love with her, and that's why she was so <u title="(adj) ác, tàn nhẫn (ngày 120)">cruel</u> to me. So now you can understand why I didn't want to go to the reunion.</p>

      <p>Yeah, I had changed a lot, but the <u title="(ns) những vết thương (ngày 171)">wounds</u> were still deep inside. But my therapist was of a different opinion. They thought I should go to the party and talk to my <u title="(ns) những kẻ lạm dụng, ngược đãi (ngày 136)">abusers</u>. And not just talk. I needed to forgive them. This would <mark>put me out of my misery</mark>. So I gathered all my strength and arrived at the <mark>appointed place</mark>. But what happened at this party just turned my world around. I was very surprised that all the guys were happy to see me. Everyone was interested in what I was doing and even <u title="(v-ed) khen ngợi (ngày 11)">complimented</u> me. Everyone said I was a <u title="(adj) trưởng thành, chín chắn (ngày 173)">mature</u> and cute guy. Yeah, if they only knew how many times I had to go to the dentist and <mark>cosmetologist</mark> to clean myself up and get rid of complexes about my appearance.</p>

      <p>It was nice, but I didn`t really want to talk to them because I was looking for Sarah and Jasmine. Soon I saw Sarah alone at the table. I said hello to her, and I wanted to ask where her friend was, but it looked like Sarah had already had a few drinks because she immediately started complaining to me about her life. She was already divorced, and she felt unhappy. But suddenly her mood changed and she started <u title="(v-ing) tán tỉnh, tà lưa (ngày 207)">flirting</u> with me.</p>

      <p>At that moment, I realized that I could take advantage of this and <mark>get back at her</mark>. All I had to do was listen to her and <u title="(v) gật đầu (ngày 218)">nod</u> <u title="đúng lúc (ngày 77)">in time</u>. And half an hour later, we were kissing. I knew what it was all about, so I offered her a ride to her house. I'll skip the details, but I spent the night with her.</p>

      <p>In the morning, I watched her sleep, and I felt so good about <u title="việc lợi dụng (ngày 312)">taking advantage of</u> a girl who had hurt me at school. And then I <u title="nảy ra (ý tưởng) (ngày 128)">came up with</u> a whole plan to <u title="làm xấu hổ, xấu mặt (ngày 122)">embarrass</u> them both. All I had to do was take a selfie with her in bed, and then quickly go home to pack my stuff. The thing is, Sarah told me that Jasmine didn't show up for the reunion because she was leaving for a trip to Paris this morning. My overnight success with Sarah made me realize that I had a chance to do the same with Jasmine. Oh, the feeling of revenge was much more pleasant than forgiveness. So I raced down the road as fast as I could to arrive at the airport on time.</p>

      <p>I checked everything, there was only one flight to Paris this morning, and thank God there were available seats on it. I was on time, and all I had to do was to "accidentally" <mark>bump into her</mark> in the <dfn data-inf="(n) hàng chờ lên&#10;máy bay">boarding queue</dfn>. And so I did. Jasmine was very surprised to see me. Then we had a little chat, and I found out that she was traveling alone, because she had recently broken up with her boyfriend, and wanted to have a good time. Perfect. I suggested that we should stick together in Paris and figure out what to do. She agreed. Great! The first part of the plan was complete.</p>

      <p>However, the second half was much more difficult. The thing is, I needed to <u title="(v) quyến rũ (ngày 222)">seduce</u> her. And in this situation, the city itself helped me do it. Paris is the most romantic city in the world. On the very first day, we saw all the main sights, climbed to the top of the Eiffel tower, and tried like half of all the <u title="ẩm thực nước Pháp (ngày 254)">French cuisine</u>. We decided to end the day in a restaurant with a couple of glasses of wine. Paris inspired us to have romantic conversations, and when I <u title="đi cùng (về) (ngày 8)">accompanied</u> Jasmine back to her hotel, she invited me to come in. Wow, I didn't expect this to happen on the very first day. I also didn't expect this from myself because of my self-esteem. But two successes <u title="liên tiếp (ngày 73)">in a row</u> have made it clear that I've done a good job on myself, and I've changed a lot since school. I didn't forget my main goal, though, and after a beautiful night with Jasmine, I had a few more <mark>compromising photos</mark>.</p>

      <p>But it didn't end that night, because we still had a whole week ahead of us. So every day we got more interested in each other. Most importantly, I remembered those feelings from when I liked Jasmine at school, and they came back to life. I'm definitely <u title="thích (ngày 311)">head over heels in love</u> with her again. However, I didn't have the <u title="sự dũng cảm (ngày 36)">courage</u> to <u title="(v) thú nhận (ngày 151)">confess</u> it at the time. Soon our little vacation was coming to an end, and we were spending the last night together. But I didn't want it to end. I even forgot about my stupid revenge plan. I wanted us to go back to America and continue our relationship.</p>

      <p>We stayed up until the sunrise together on the balcony, it was a very romantic moment. I <u title="(v-ed) dồn hết (ngày 197)">gathered</u> my strength and told her everything. But her response was not positive. She was happy to spend time with me, but she had no feelings for me at all. In addition, she couldn't stop thinking about her ex-boyfriend, and she wanted to go back to him. Damn, I was just <mark>shattered</mark> at that moment. I had hope, and now it was destroyed. It's like all the lights in the whole world have been turned off.</p> 

      <p>I came home feeling very <u title="(adj) chán nản, tuyệt vọng (ngày 226)">depressed</u>. I was alone, and I could feel bad thoughts <mark>creeping up on</mark> me. I was afraid that my panic attacks might return. I missed her for a month or so, and soon my sadness turned to anger. I was mad at Jasmine. How could she do this to me? So she was just playing on my feelings. Again. And at one point, I remembered my plan. Yes, I was going to make it a reality, and I had everything I needed to do it. I just had to wait until the next reunion.</p>

      <p>I was <u title="giữ (trong lòng) (ngày 289)">holding on to</u> a lot of anger during that time, and I was going to explode. The year of waiting was very painful, but it was worth it. Soon the group chat started talking about the reunion again, and I started <mark>plotting</mark> my revenge.</p> 

      <p>I went to the party, talked to everyone, and pretended that I was happy to see them. As I expected, Sarah and Jasmine avoided me. At one point, I said that I had prepared a surprise for everyone. It was a small clip from our school photos that I found in old albums. I even brought a projector especially for this moment. So everyone sat down and I turned on the video. Everyone at once began to be touched and <mark>nostalgic</mark> about the past. However, after a dozen old photos, I showed them a few new ones. Yep, these were my selfies with Sarah and Jasmine. This was a shame for them and I got my revenge. Oh, you should have seen their faces. Surprise, shame, and anger just blended together, and then they started yelling at me. Oh man, I'm not going to say out loud what they told me.</p>

      <p>But the crowd's reaction was pretty unexpected. I thought that all my classmates would laugh at this and support me, but I was wrong. They sided with the girls, and they also <mark>condemned</mark> me. Unfortunately, I left the party as a <mark>disgrace</mark>. What a shame. I was like the little boy that everyone laughed at and that everyone hated. I felt bad again and had a panic attack. I could barely get home.</p>

      <p>I quickly ran into the bedroom and hid under the covers. But nothing helped. I felt <u title="(adj) chóng mặt (ngày 167)">dizzy</u>, my heart was <mark>pounding</mark>, and I didn't have enough air to breathe. Soon I was so tired that I just <u title="đã ngất xỉu (ngày 139)">passed out</u> and slept until almost noon.</p>

      <p>But unfortunately, my problems were just beginning. The thing is, Sarah and Jasmine weren't going to leave it just like that. So they <u title="buộc tội tôi vì tội (ngày 206)">accused me of</u>... Let's just say they accused me of getting close to them <mark>fraudulently</mark>, and that our relationship was not <mark>consensual</mark>. These were serious charges, and I could actually go to jail. But they were more <mark>merciful</mark> than I thought. They said they would drop the charges if I paid them <u title="bồi thường thiệt hạt về đạo đức (ngày 23 + 305)">moral compensation</u>. Despite the fact that the amount was huge, I agreed. I was willing to give them anything to avoid going to jail.</p> 

      <p>As it <u title="hóa ra (ngày 145)">turned out</u>, they were just trying to scare me. Money was just a nice bonus. I must say, they did it well. I thought I was going to lose my mind before it was over.</p>

      <p>Now I <u title="(v) hối hận (ngày 80)">regret</u> what I did very much. I can't believe I'd been <mark>hatching</mark> this plan for a year. For the whole year, this fire of <mark>hatred</mark> burned in me. But in the end, I was the only one who <u title="gánh chịu (ngày 212)">suffered</u> from it. I thought I <u title="đã loại bỏ (ngày 116)">got rid of</u> my problems, but I only made them worse. I should have listened to my therapist. I should have just forgiven them for their past. Hate and revenge have only brought more problems into my life that I will have to fix.</p>
