     <p>Hi, guys. My name is Meg, and I want to talk to you about a very <u title="(adj) nhạy cảm (ngày 240)">sensitive</u> subject. Recently I had problems with my uhh... women's health. And I know that my boyfriend <u title="(v-ed) đã lây nhiễm (ngày 269)">infected</u> me. But the thing is, I had three boyfriends, and I had to do an <mark>investigation</mark> to find the <mark>culprit</mark>.</p>

      <p>I was a second-year college student, and I was happy in my relationship with my boyfriend, Mike. However, after a while, I felt the need to date other guys. No, I still loved Mike, I just..... I just wanted someone else. I thought I was <mark>polyamorous</mark>, and I thought it was okay to be in love with multiple people at the same time. Although my friends said that I was just too <u title="(adj) ngớ ngẩn, phù phiếm (ngày 221)">frivolous</u>. But I decided that I was polyamorous for a reason.</p>

      <p>There was this guy, Bob, and I met him in my college <mark>choir</mark>. God, he had such a beautiful voice! We talked a little bit, I tried to <u title="(v) tán tỉnh, tà lưa (ngày 207)">flirt</u> with him, and he <u title="(v-ed) đã đáp lại (ngày 232)">reciprocated</u>! Oh, I was so happy, and I definitely wanted to date him!</p>

      <p>However, I had to talk to Mike about it first. I loved him, and it was important to me that there was an agreement in our relationship. So one day I <mark>plucked up the courage</mark> to start talking about it. However, Mike reacted extremely negatively. He started <u title="quát nạt (ngày 131)">yelling at</u> me, and he thought I was crazy. He literally turned as red as a tomato because of his anger and <u title="(n) sự ghen tuông (ngày 154)">jealousy</u>. In the end, he gave me an <u title="(n) tối hậu thư - lời đe dọa/cảnh báo đưa ra những điều kiện buộc đối phương phải chấp nhận, thi hành theo, nếu không sẽ dùng những biện pháp quyết liệt (ngày 229)">ultimatum</u>. He wanted to be my only boyfriend, otherwise, we'd have to break up.</p>

      <p>Of course, I didn't want to <u title="từ bỏ (ngày 305)">part with</u> Mike, because I loved him, and we had a lot of things in common. But it's 2020! We are <dfn data-inf="(adj) hiện đại">progressive</dfn> people, and I was not his <u title="(n) tài sản (ngày 83)">property</u>! I should have had <u title="(n) quyền (ngày 144)">the right</u> to choose!</p>

      <p>I thought about what to do for a few days, and then I came to a <u title="(n) sự thỏa hiệp, đôi bên cùng có lợi (ngày 46)">compromise</u>. Mike was <u title="(adj) thân yêu (ngày 304)">dear</u> to me, but I was also <mark>head over heels in love</mark> with Bob. So I decided to <u title="ngoại tình (ngày 226)">have an affair</u> in secret.</p>

      <p>And the very next day after choir class, I went to have coffee with Bob. From that moment on, I had two boyfriends who I loved equally. Of course, I had to keep the relationship a secret, but this is a <u title="(n) sự hi sinh (ngày 224)">sacrifice</u> that I was <u title="sẵn sàng (gánh chịu) (ngày 74)">willing</u> to make in order to feel alive and like a complete person.</p>

      <p>Although this sometimes brought a lot of problems.</p>

      <p>The problem was that I wanted to see my boyfriends literally every day. And sometimes I'd say good-bye to Bob at the cafe and <u title="(v) vội vội vàng vàng (ngày 209)">rush</u> home to Mike to spend time with him. But the hardest part was that they both went to the same college as me! I felt like I was in this PAC-man game. I walked the halls and tried to not <mark>inadvertently</mark> meet the two of them at the same time. But I have to admit, it was very <u title="(adj) thú vị (hồi hộp + kịch tính) (ngày 241)">thrilling</u>.</p>

      <p>But very soon the difficulty level of my game increased again. My friend called me to a cafe just to chat, but there was a strange guy with her. As I found out later, he liked me a lot, but he was shy about asking me out. So my friend arranged a meeting for us. You know, I would have been very angry with my friend for this kind of setup, but this guy, Nick, <u title="hóa ra (ngày 180)">turned out</u> to be really nice. He was <u title="liên tục (ngày 193)">constantly</u> <u title="(v-ing) nói lắp (ngày 292)">stuttering</u> and <mark>blushing</mark>. It was clear that he was very nervous, and it <u title="(v-ed) làm tôi thích thú (ngày 12)">amused me</u>. I guess his awkwardness <u title="(v-ed) làm tan chảy (ngày 44)">melted</u> my heart. We talked for almost two hours without a break, and I really wanted to see him again. And that's how I got my third boyfriend.</p>

      <p>Yes, I know how this looks, but try to understand my feelings! I liked all of them! I had feelings for Mike, Bob, and Nick! And I wasn't ready to <u title="từ bỏ">part with</u> any of them! However, none of them were ready for a polyamorous relationship, so this was my way out and my way to be happy. And if you think it was easy for me, it was not!</p>

      <p>Every day I planned everything so that my day would run on time, and no one would <u title="(v) nghi ngờ (ngày 276)">suspect</u> anything. I was literally like an evil genius who had a blackboard with a bunch of newspaper clippings, photos, and plans that were connected by a red thread. And I was able to live like this for almost three months.</p>

      <p>But then I was faced with the greatest challenge. It was Valentine's Day. It was literally my official holiday because I was probably the most in love person on the planet. And I wanted to pay attention to all my boyfriends on that day. So I <u title="nảy ra (ý tưởng) (ngày 128)">came up with</u> a complicated plan. Oh, it was a whole special operation.</p>

      <p>To be able to spend time with all of them, I had to show incredible time management skills. So I decided to go ahead and meet my first boyfriend, Mike, right at midnight. I arrived at his house, and at 12:01 am I called him and asked him to look out the window. And a second later, he saw me on the sidewalk with a heart-shaped balloon. Of course, he did not expect this, and stood <u title="bàng hoàng, choáng váng (ngày 208)">in a daze</u> for a couple of seconds. But this is exactly what I wanted! So he let me in, we started kissing, and then we turned off the lights and spent the whole night together.</p> 

      <p>In the morning, Mike wanted to talk about something, but I didn't have time for it, because I had to run to Bob. So I just said a quick goodbye to Mike and left.</p> 

      <p>Bob had another surprise for me. It was a romantic picnic. We drove to a lake far out of town. We were sitting on the grass in a very <u title="(adj) hoang vắng, vắng vẻ (ngày 16)">deserted</u> place. The beautiful view of the mountains and the lake really created a very romantic atmosphere. Plus, no one could see us, so we could fully enjoy each other.</p>

      <p>But after a few hours, I had to run to another date, so I had to lie to Bob and say that my parents needed help <u title="(adv) rất cấp bách (ngày 53)">urgently</u> and that I had to go home. So he drove me to my house, and I had a little time to prepare for my final date of the day. A quick trip to the shower, half an hour in front of the mirror, make-up, and then a <mark>chic</mark> evening dress. My date with Nick was at an expensive restaurant, so I had to <mark>look the part</mark>.</p>

      <p>I have to say, it was an amazing night, and Nick did everything he could to make me happy. After that, we went to his house, and I was faced with another sleepless night, if you know what I mean.</p>

      <p>In the morning, I called a taxi, and I <u title="gần như không thể (lết về nhà) (ngày 304)">could barely get home</u>. I was so tired that I just couldn't wait to get off of my feet. I threw my dress on the floor, and without even washing off my makeup, I just jumped into bed.</p>

      <p>Oh, I never thought that a regular dream could be so pleasant. I slept until the next day, but I still felt very tired. Although I was incredibly pleased with myself because my plan worked like a <u title="(n) đồng hồ Thụy Sĩ (ngày 178)">Swiss watch</u>. My boyfriends texted me and asked to meet, but I thought I needed a little break, and I just wanted to lie in bed for a couple of days before diving back into this game where I would have to walk through a <mark>minefield</mark> so that Mike, Bob, and Nick wouldn't find out about each other.</p>

      <p>However, two days later, something unpleasant happened that caused my perfect <mark>mechanism</mark> to break down in just one day. As I said, it was a women's health issue, and I immediately went to the doctor with it.</p>

      <p>There was nothing wrong with it, and I was going to be cured in a couple of weeks. But what this did mean was that one of my boyfriends had passed the infection on to me. This, <mark>in turn</mark>, meant that one of them had <u title="đã lừa dối, cắm sừng (ngày 147)">cheated on</u> me and I couldn't <u title="(v) chịu đựng, đứng yên mà không làm gì (ngày 309)">stand</u> it.</p>

      <p>I know I wasn't a loyal girlfriend myself, but at least I was honest, and I tried to say that I wanted a polyamorous relationship. In addition, I had to inform my partners about the disease, so unpleasant conversations were <mark>inevitable</mark>.</p>

      <p>My first <u title="(n) đối tượng bị tình nghi (ngày 276)">suspect</u> was Nick. Sometimes he acted strangely, as if he were hiding something. I always <mark>chalked it up to</mark> his shyness, but then I thought that he was acting strangely because he was hiding his <mark>infidelity</mark>. That's what I told him, and I <u title="(v-ed) đã buộc tội anh ta vì tội (ngày 206)">accused him of</u> infecting me. But his reaction was very unexpected. He went from being a quiet and shy guy to an angry screamer. He <u title="(v-ed) lăng mạ (ngày 52)">insulted</u> me and said that I was the cheater. <u title="Đúng hơn là (ngày 166)">More precisely</u>, he used a different word, more <u title="(adj) xúc phạm (ngày 52)">offensive</u>.</p>

      <p>Of course, after this, my relationship with him ended, because the topics of infidelity and <mark>treason</mark> had surfaced between us, although none of us <u title="(v-ed) nhận, thừa nhận (ngày 135)">admitted</u> it. But he was <u title="(adj) chân thành, thành thật (ngày 4)">sincere</u>, and I didn't think he was lying, so I still had two more suspects. I thought it was definitely Bob, because Mike was with me from the very beginning, and he would never cheat on me because he was a <u title="(adj) có nguyên tắc, có đạo đức (ngày 86)">principled</u> guy.</p>

      <p>So I went to Bob's house. As soon as he opened the door, I started yelling at him. I was one hundred percent sure it was him, and I <mark>didn't mince words</mark> at all. Unfortunately, I was so angry that I didn't even notice that his parents were sitting in the living room, and they heard the whole conversation.</p>

      <p>Oh, there was so much noise in the next second. Everyone yelled at me and just kicked me out of the house. Yes, it was definitely him. Bob cheated on me, and now he's hiding at home just to avoid admitting his <mark>indiscretion</mark>. But I still had one unpleasant conversation ahead, because I had to tell Mike about the illness so that he could also go to the doctor.</p>

      <p>It was very awkward for me to speak about it because you obviously already understand that the topic of conversation was quite sensitive.</p>

      <p>But suddenly Mike interrupted me and said that he had a <u title="(n) chuyện cần tâm sự, thú nhận (ngày 151)">confession</u> to make, and this shocked me twice. First, he said that he knew that I was cheating on him, and that I had broken our agreement. And then he admitted that he also started an affair on the side. But what happened between us on Valentine's Day was just his revenge. He just <mark>took advantage of</mark> me. And he wanted to tell me all about it back then, but I quickly left without listening to him.</p>

      <p>And that was the end of my investigation. The case was closed, and I felt <u title="(adj) tồi tệ (ngày 298)">terrible</u>. Until recently, I had three Boyfriends and I was just so happy, but now I'm alone. Worst of all, it was my <u title="lỗi của tôi (ngày 116)">own fault</u>, because none of this would have happened if I'd been honest with my boyfriend. But I decided to lie, and I brought problems to people who didn't <u title="(v) đáng, xứng đáng (ngày 16)">deserve</u> them.</p>
