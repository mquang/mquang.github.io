      <p>Vanessa:The next topic is sports and exercise, so I want to know when you were a kid, what kind of sports or activities did you participate in?
    
    </p><p>Dan: Man, I played a lot of sports.
    
    </p><p>Vanessa: Yeah?
    
    </p><p>Dan: Yeah, I think it kind of shows the <u title="đặc lợi, (may mắn) có nhiều cơ hội hơn người khác (ngày 233)">privilege</u> we grew up in, that we had so many <u title="nhiều cơ hội (ngày 58)">opportunities</u> to try so many different things.
    
    </p><p>Vanessa: That was really lucky to be able to do that kind of stuff.
    
    </p><p>Dan: So first I started out with baseball, but it was called t-ball, so you actually put the ball on a <mark>tee</mark>, and you put the ball there, and you just hit it off of it.
    
    </p><p>Vanessa: So no one's throwing the ball.
    
    </p><p>Dan: Yeah, I was really little.
    
    </p><p>Vanessa: It's just <mark>stationary</mark>.
    
    </p><p>Dan: And I actually remember when the coaches started <u title="ném bóng (ngày 150)">pitching</u> to me, I got kind of scared of the ball and I didn't want to play anymore.
    
    </p><p>Vanessa: It's <u title="">a big deal</u>.
    
    </p><p>Dan: Yeah, I was really little, so I stopped playing that and I started playing soccer.
    
    </p><p>Vanessa: Oh, okay.
    
    </p><p>Dan: And swimming as well. So you call it, probably football in your country, but it's interesting, many, many children, play soccer in America.
    
    </p><p>Vanessa: Yeah, I think it's easy to <mark>get into</mark> because you just are running and kicking a ball.
    
    </p><p>Dan: Sure.
    
    </p><p>Vanessa: There's no equipment or <u title="cần chuyên môn, kĩ thuật (ngày 18)">specialized</u> movements-
    
    </p><p>Dan: Right.
    
    </p><p>Vanessa: ... at least for kids.
    
    </p><p>Dan: But for some reason, it's not a popular sport to watch.
    
    </p><p>Vanessa: Or for adults, a lot of adults don't play soccer.
    
    </p><p>Dan: Adults don't play soccer that much, it's just children.
    
    </p><p>Vanessa: Yeah.
    
    </p><p>Dan: But I played soccer for probably like six year.
    
    </p><p>Vanessa: Oh.
    
    </p><p>Dan: And then I never played it again. Yeah.
    
    </p><p>Vanessa: Just as a kid.
    
    </p><p>Dan: Yep.
    
    So I did that, and I did swimming, and gymnastics for a while. I had a phase where I used to like to do a lot of flips-
    
    </p><p>Vanessa: Oh, cool.
    
    </p><p>Dan: ... so I would jump on the <mark>trampoline</mark> and do back flips and front flips.
    
    </p><p>Vanessa: In a <mark>gymnasium</mark> that's like a gymnastics center.
    
    </p><p>Dan: Yeah, but also in my backyard. We had a trampoline.
    
    </p><p>Vanessa: Ah, cool.
    
    </p><p>Dan: So I would do that, and then I did figure skating where we were doing spinning and stuff.
    
    </p><p>Vanessa: I did figure skating too.
    
    </p><p>Dan: Yes. And then my brother convinced me to take up a more manly sport, hockey.
    
    </p><p>Vanessa: Oh, it's a shame, you probably would have been really good at figure skating.
    
    </p><p>Dan: Yeah, I was all right, but-
    </p><p>Vanessa: Yeah. I think that's the kind of thing that-
    </p><p>Dan: ... it wasn't my true love-
    
    </p><p>Vanessa: Like hockey?
    
    </p><p>Dan: ... that would be hockey.
    
    </p><p>Vanessa: Well, I'm <u title="vui (ngày 89)">glad</u> that you found your true love, hockey.
    
    </p><p>Dan: I do love hockey, but I don't really have the build for it, I'm a little too small, but I still had a lot of fun playing hockey.
    
    </p><p>Vanessa: Yeah, and you still play hockey.
    
    </p><p>Dan: Mm-hmm (affirmative).
    
    </p><p>Vanessa: You play on a team here in our city.
    
    </p><p>Dan: That's not all of my sports-
    </p><p>Vanessa: I feel like as a... you had a lot of organized sports as a kid-
    </p><p>Dan: Mm-hmm (affirmative).
    
    </p><p>Vanessa: ... and maybe that's just because you have a older brother, or just something that you wanted to do, but I feel like for me-
    
    </p><p>Dan: I think my dad thought it was good for me too.
    
    </p><p>Vanessa: Oh.
    
    </p><p>Dan: Which I think is true, it's good for kids to <mark>get into</mark> organized sports.
    
    </p><p>Vanessa: Sure.
    
    Sure.
    
    I feel like for me as a kid I didn't do team
    sports as much, like we just played in the backyard a lot.
    
    </p><p>Dan: Weren't you kind of a <mark>timid</mark> child, too?
    
    </p><p>Vanessa: I wouldn't say I was timid, but I didn't like physical contact with other kids, so basketball for me was really <u title="dễ đụng chạm, va chạm">physically aggressive</u>.
    
    </p><p>Dan: Too <mark>rough</mark>.
    
    </p><p>Vanessa: Yeah, a little too rough, I didn't really like that.
    
    </p><p>Dan: You should try hockey.
    
    </p><p>Vanessa: That's very rough.
    
    But I loved swimming, so I think that swimming
    was probably the main sport of my childhood,
    
    and through high school every summer my sister
    and I were on a swim team, and that meant
    
    that every day, twice a day, we would go to
    swim practice, and I-
    
    </p><p>Dan: Vanessa's a really good swimmer, she can <mark>kick my butt</mark>.
    
    </p><p>Vanessa: Not <u title="theo nghĩa đen (ngày 168)">literally</u>, that is a <u title="theo nghĩa bóng">figurative</u> <dfn data-inf="cách diễn đạt">expression</dfn>. That means I can swim better than Dan, which is true.
    
    </p><p>Dan: It's true.
    
    </p><p>Vanessa: But it just means that I know the technique, and if Dan or you-
    
    </p><p>Dan: I'm out there like struggling.
    
    </p><p>Vanessa: ... if you know the right technique, you can have a lot of <mark>endurance</mark> because you're not wasting your energy, so I feel like I
    learned the right technique, so I can swim longer because I know the right technique
    because I practiced it a lot.
    
    So we would always swim, and then we'd have
    swim competitions, which are called swim meets,
    
    and that was a fun part of my childhood growing,
    was swimming, kind of this... it's kind of
    
    a team thing, but not really.
    
    You have a team, but you're still <u title="cá nhân, riêng biệt (ngày 105)">individual</u>.
    
    </p><p>Dan: So like combined scores, is that how
    it works?
    
    </p><p>Vanessa: Well, you would be... you're part
    of the community team, like your community,
    
    your neighborhood is the team, but then each
    person has an individual score.
    
    </p><p>Dan: Score.
    
    </p><p>Vanessa: So it's kid of a team, kid of individual,
    and I liked that.
    
    And it was not physically aggressive.
    
    </p><p>Dan: That would make me so nervous.
    
    </p><p>Vanessa: Yeah.
    
    </p><p>Dan: These individual sports, I feel the pressure
    way too much.
    
    If I were swimming and racing, I'd be so scared.
    
    But when I play a sport like basketball, you're
    on a team, and so you're kind of <u title="phụ thuộc vào (ngày 173)">depending
    
    on</u> each other more, it's not <dfn data-inf="do bạn quyết&#10;định hết">all up to you</dfn>.
    
    </p><p>Vanessa: Yeah.
    
    </p><p>Dan: Although, if you make a big mistake,
    then everybody's looking at you.
    
    </p><p>Vanessa: Yeah.
    
    </p><p>Dan: That's no fun.
    
    </p><p>Vanessa: Yeah, I feel like I like having a
    team, but at the same time, I like having
    
    kind of your own thing going on, you can kind
    of be more individualistic.
    
    </p><p>Dan: Yeah.
    
    </p><p>Vanessa: So I'm <u title="tò mò (ngày 203)">curious</u> for you, growing up
    did you play organized sports like Dan?
    
    I also did some volleyball in high school,
    those types of things, kind of organized sports.
    
    But did you play organized sports like that,
    or did you just play with your friends in
    
    the neighborhood, like I did growing up with
    my friends in the neighborhood?
    
    What kind of activities, or exercise type
    things did you do when you were a child?
    
    All right, let's go to the next topic.</p>
