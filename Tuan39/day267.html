      <p>Vanessa: The next topic is housing. I want you to dream big, if you could have your dream home, what three features would it have? Let's say this is a dream home, this is idealistic, this is not realistic.

</p><p>Dan: This is probably not going to happen to us.

</p><p>Vanessa: No, but it's just a dream. Everyone can dream, right?

</p><p>Dan: Yeah.

</p><p>Vanessa: What would you ideally love to have?

</p><p>Dan: A palace. A castle.

</p><p>Vanessa: Hopefully you can hire some people to clean it at that point.

</p><p>Dan: Okay, not really. So the features of the home?

</p><p>Vanessa: Yes, what three features would you love to have if you could dream and build your own home?

</p><p>Dan: Okay. Well, first, I would want the living room, and I don't know is a living common in other countries?

</p><p>Vanessa: Yeah, a place where you have a <mark>couch</mark>,
and maybe a TV.

</p><p>Dan: This is where you gather together, where
you have the couch, and where you visit with

friends.

I would like this room to be <mark>humongous</mark>, and
have a really large window.

</p><p>Vanessa: Are we talking soccer field size
humongous, or are we talking like twice as

big as a normal one?

</p><p>Dan: I'm talking football stadium big.

</p><p>Vanessa: Okay.

</p><p>Dan: No, not really.

Just large.

Large ceilings, <mark>vaulted</mark> ceilings as they say
in the industry.

</p><p>Vanessa: Okay.

</p><p>Dan: And a very large window.

</p><p>Vanessa: Okay.

</p><p>Dan: Or large windows.

</p><p>Vanessa: I said the same thing.

I would like a main room with a big window.

</p><p>Dan: Yes, but there's more.

</p><p>Vanessa: Okay.

</p><p>Dan: And it needs a great view, an incredible
view.

</p><p>Vanessa: Oh, what's a good view for you?

What would be an ideal view?

</p><p>Dan: I really love looking out at the ocean,
that would be great.

I'm not a big fan of where I live on the East
Coast of America, the beaches are all kind

of the same to me.

They're not my favorite.

This would be in the Mediterranean, on a big
cliff.

</p><p>Vanessa: Oh, so it wouldn't be-
</p><p>Dan: Yeah, a cliff side home.

</p><p>Vanessa: ... in the U.S., okay.

</p><p>Dan: Yeah, it wouldn't be in the U.S., sorry
U.S.

Well, maybe somewhere in the U.S. I don't
know.

</p><p>Vanessa: Could be Pacific Northwest, you've
never been there.

You don't know.

</p><p>Dan: It may be the Pacific Northwest, maybe
that's my kind of ocean view.

</p><p>Vanessa: Yeah, so you'd like an ocean view?

</p><p>Dan: It'd be really high.

Looking down on my kingdom.

</p><p>Vanessa: So you'd need to be a king too?

</p><p>Dan: I have to be a king in this <mark>scenario</mark>.

</p><p>Vanessa: This is getting a little excessive.

</p><p>Dan: So yeah, a really big, open ocean view.

Remember, this is dreaming.

</p><p>Vanessa: This is dreaming.

All right, keep dreaming.

What else would you like?

</p><p>Dan: All right, so it's very open, so close
by would be a very epic, open kitchen.

</p><p>Vanessa: Oh, so open you mean it's connected
to the living space?

</p><p>Dan: Yeah, this is popular, I think, nowadays
in architecture.

</p><p>Vanessa: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

</p><p>Dan: Yeah, so open to the living room.

</p><p>Vanessa: So as you're cooking-
</p><p>Dan: At least-

</p><p>Vanessa: ... you can still talk to your guests.

</p><p>Dan: Yeah, at least part of the kitchen would
be visible.

</p><p>Vanessa: Yeah, so at the moment, our kitchen
is open to the living room.

</p><p>Dan: Yes, we have this now.

</p><p>Vanessa: We don't have an epic, giant-
</p><p>Dan: Except for the view.

</p><p>Vanessa: ... living room with a view of the
Mediterranean.

</p><p>Dan: And the big kitchen.

</p><p>Vanessa: Yes, but we have an open space, so
it's kind of like one room.

Our kitchen is connected to our living space,
so when our guests, or our friends, or our

family, or our kids are in the living space,
the living room, we can see them and still

kind of interact.

So this type of layout is pretty popular,
at least in newer houses, or as people <mark>remodel</mark>

their houses, they're kind of looking for
this open layout, is what it's called.

</p><p>Dan: Yeah, it's called an open floor plan.

</p><p>Vanessa: Open floor plan, that's the word.

Yeah.

So anything else you would like in this amazing
house?

</p><p>Dan: Yes, there's one more thing in my <mark>palace</mark>.

</p><p>Vanessa: Okay, in your <mark>kingdom</mark>.

</p><p>Dan: In my kingdom.

So there would be a game room, because I love
games a lot.

</p><p>Vanessa: Okay, what kind of games?

</p><p>Dan: All kinds of games.

So we actually rented a place like this that
was very similar.

</p><p>Vanessa: Oh, like your grandparents rented
that beach house.

</p><p>Dan: Actually my grandma rented it.

It was a beach house, so it was like four
layers of house.

</p><p>Vanessa: That's crazy.

</p><p>Dan: It was humongous.

It was called The Ritz-
</p><p>Vanessa: Of course.

</p><p>Dan: ... which is like a <mark>fancy</mark> thing.

So the very top floor of this building was
just this giant game room.

They had a <mark>pool table</mark>, they had a-
</p><p>Vanessa: A <mark>ping-pong</mark>.

</p><p>Dan: Oh, that was... the ping-pong table was
somewhere else.

But in palace, the ping-pong table would be
in the same room.

</p><p>Vanessa: So <mark>ping-pong</mark>, <mark>foosball</mark>, <mark>pool</mark>.

</p><p>Dan: Other games too, chess, yeah.

</p><p>Vanessa: Oh, board game cabinets.

</p><p>Dan: There would be all kinds of games.

There'd be a TV with video games, it'd just
be fun everywhere.

</p><p>Vanessa: Okay, so you want a whole big room?

</p><p>Dan: And then I'd have to lock it up so I
didn't go in, because I'd spend all my time

in there.

</p><p>Vanessa: Okay, so you'd have to request the
key from one of the people?

</p><p>Dan: You.

</p><p>Vanessa: From me?

Okay.

</p><p>Dan: "Gate keeper, let me in the game room."

</p><p>Vanessa: I'm sorry to say, but in my dream
home-

</p><p>Dan: There's no game room?

</p><p>Vanessa: ... there is not a game room, although
it's a fun idea.

It's a good idea.

</p><p>Dan: Save that for the vacation home?

</p><p>Vanessa: Yeah, that's good if your grandparents
rent a house for a week and invite all the

family.

</p><p>Dan: Yes, it was perfect for that.

</p><p>Vanessa: That's a good thing to have, but
maybe not in my forever house.

</p><p>Dan: Okay, what's your forever dream home
look like?

</p><p>Vanessa: Well, I did say I'd like a main room
with a big window.

I think that would be really great.

So we have some-
</p><p>Dan: But what's your ideal view?

</p><p>Vanessa: I didn't really say.

I feel like it doesn't have to be the beach,
maybe not someone else's house right there,

but it could be the mountains, that would
be nice.

</p><p>Dan: Sure.

</p><p>Vanessa: But I also like-
</p><p>Dan: Any kind of <mark>picturesque</mark> view.

</p><p>Vanessa: ... I don't like to be <mark>isolated</mark>,
so if you have a beautiful mountain view,

that means you probably live in the middle
of the mountains away from everybody.

</p><p>Dan: It's true.

</p><p>Vanessa: So I don't mind if the view's not
perfect, but I'd just like to have a big window

with lots of light, that'd be really great.

The other thing that I said is a little more
practical, and that is a huge studio room

with different walls that I can film on.

</p><p>Dan: Very practical for the Fearless Fluency
Club.

</p><p>Vanessa: Yes.

</p><p>Dan: Oh, wait, and for YouTube.

</p><p>Vanessa: Yes.

So for, of course, the fearless fluency club,
and also for YouTube, having different locations

where I can easily film.

And the room where we often film videos, in
here, it's okay.

It's not super small, but I have an image
of-

</p><p>Dan: It's pretty small.

</p><p>Vanessa: ... four different walls with different
backgrounds and different things that I can

move lights and easily have different locations
to film, I think that would be really cool.

So I'm starting out small, we have this room,
and then maybe someday in my dream home.

</p><p>Dan: Yeah, this is way better than our other
house.

</p><p>Vanessa: Oh, yeah, where we used to live in
the apartment.

</p><p>Dan: She used to film in a closet.

</p><p>Vanessa: It wasn't a closet, but it was really
small.

</p><p>Dan: Two closets combined.

</p><p>Vanessa: Yeah, it was like a little triangle
room.

</p><p>Dan: It was very small.

</p><p>Vanessa: But-
</p><p>Dan: Hey, we made it work.

</p><p>Vanessa: Yeah, it worked.

We made it work.

And the other feature that I would like is,
in a dream home, is a <mark>roof deck</mark>.

</p><p>Dan: That's cool.

</p><p>Vanessa: Yeah, so some stairs, and then a
little roof-

</p><p>Dan: This is the adventurer in Vanessa speaking.

</p><p>Vanessa: ... on the top so you can look down
everywhere.

</p><p>Dan: But that's in my house, too.

</p><p>Vanessa: Oh, it's in your house?

Oh, good.

Maybe we can have a house together.

And also at night you could lay up there and
see the stars.

I think that would be really cool-
</p><p>Dan: Yeah, that would be neat.

</p><p>Vanessa: ... so you could have a perfect place
to stargaze.

</p><p>Dan: I don't know why more houses don't have
this.

</p><p>Vanessa: Yeah, we should put a deck on top
of our house.

</p><p>Dan: Yeah, why not?

</p><p>Vanessa: Yeah.

</p><p>Dan: Maybe some architect out there has a
reason.

"Well, actually it's bad for <mark>structural integrity</mark>."

</p><p>Vanessa: I think that people just don't value
<mark>stargazing</mark> like we do.

</p><p>Dan: Maybe.

</p><p>Vanessa: It's really cool to see the stars
at night, and especially if you're... if you

just have a perfect view from a rooftop deck.

</p><p>Dan: You're <mark>perched</mark> in a high place.

</p><p>Vanessa: Yeah, that'd be really cool.

Well, it was nice to dream.

Thanks for dreaming with me.

</p><p>Dan: Yeah.

Oh, dream's over.

</p><p>Vanessa: Yeah.

I'm curious for you, if you could have your
dream home, what features would you like in

that home?

All right, let's go to the next topic.</p>
