      <p>Hi everyone, my name is Michael, I'm 20 years old and six months ago I left College so I could date my teacher.</p> 

      <p>Since high school, I’ve been very popular among my peers. I'm not <u title="(v-ing) khoe khoang, nói phách, nổ (ngày 219)">bragging</u>, but just so you know how popular, I once dated three girls at the same time. Two of them even knew about the others, but still wanted to date me. In college, everything was the same. Not with these girls, but I got a lot of female attention in general. Again, I'm not bragging, I just want you to understand what <u title="làm mất hay, mất hứng thú (ngày 206)">spoiled</u> me. Over time, I got bored with girls my age and how they seemed to have the same troubles and worries every single time.</p>

      <p>But then, right when I had almost given into my <mark>boredom</mark>, she came along... A new AP calculus teacher. I was very interested in Miss Clarke, or should I say, Eloise, right away. I was <u title="(v) bị lôi cuốn, hấp dẫn (ngày 190)">fascinated</u> by her low voice. She was a 32-year-old woman with a lot of life experience. The age difference wasn't a problem for me. <u title="Trái lại (ngày 4)">On the contrary</u>, it made Eloise seem much hotter. Plus, she was single. So, she had everything that I was missing.</p>

      <p>Now, I don't like to wait long before making the first move, so a couple of days later, I brought her flowers. Well, I tried to bring them... After she was done with work, I walked with her all the way to her house, but she wouldn't accept them. Then, of course, I got upset, but I at least I found out where she lived.</p>

      <p>Over the next week, every single morning, I would leave little <mark>bouquets of flowers</mark> on her <mark>porch</mark>, and after that, I would make sure our paths crossed throughout the day and try to get her to talk to me. But she still <u title="(v-ed) làm ngơ, phớt lờ (ngày 206)">ignored</u> me. It <u title="hóa ra là (ngày 180)">turned out that</u> the reason she ignored me was that I wasn’t her only <u title="(n) người yêu thích, ngưỡng mộ (ngày 221)">admirer</u>. She had more than a few. And you know, it's not that surprising. It's hard to walk past a woman like Eloise, knowing that she's single.</p>

      <p>But the <u title="(n) cuộc cạnh tranh (ngày 19)">competition</u> didn't <u title="(v) làm tôi sợ">scare</u> me, so I continued trying to win her heart. I brought her flowers (mostly at night). And on one of these nights, something incredible happened. As soon as I put another bouquet on the porch, Eloise opened the door, and after a short pause, she invited me inside with a <u title="(n) cử chỉ ngón tay (ngày 161)">finger gesture</u>...</p>

      <p>I was both surprised and worried because she had <u title="hầu như không (ngày 304)">barely</u> <u title="(v-ed) khơi mào, khởi đầu (ngày 105)">initiated</u> anything before. Why was she suddenly so <u title="behaving as if you are sexually attracted to someone (ngày 207)">flirty</u>?! I noticed an almost empty bottle of wine in her room. Judging by her behavior, she had probably just finished drinking it.</p>

      <p>Eloise had nothing but a <mark>robe</mark> on. How do I know this?! Well, as soon as I tried to talk to her, she threw off her robe and started kissing me... I <u title="hầu như không">barely</u> had time to <mark>get myself together</mark>... Just so you know, I'm no <mark>sucker</mark> I just liked her way too much to start our relationship this way... Soo... I stopped her.</p> 

      <p>Yes, I stopped a hot woman from kissing me... Okay, maybe I'm a bit of a sucker, but listen. When she <u title="biết nghĩ, minh mẫn trở lại (ngày 286)">came to her senses</u>, we finally talked. It <u title="hóa ra là">turned out that</u> this "performance" was because of her <u title="(n) sự bực bội (ngày 117)">frustration</u> with men. <u title="Theo như (lời kể)">According to</u> her, all of her boyfriends wanted only one thing from her... Well, everyone except me, <u title="(adv) có vẻ vậy (ngày 41)">apparently</u>.</p>

      <p>After our conversation, she wanted to be alone, she kissed me goodbye on the cheek. At that moment, I felt myself getting closer to her heart.</p>

      <p>To earn some money, I found a job at my dad's construction firm and started combining work with College. It was difficult, but I tried to impress Eloise in a more <u title="(adj) thanh lịch (ngày 290)">elegant</u> way. After I got my first <u title="(n) phiếu lương (ngày 71)">paycheck</u>, I bought her more gifts, and when she realized that I wasn’t <mark>backing down</mark>, she gave up.</p>

      <p>One day, she invited me to her house and after we had coffee, she finally admitted that she also liked me. The only thing she was worried about was the College administration. It was obvious how they would react to a teacher having a romantic relationship with a student.</p> 

      <p>So we agreed to meet secretly. Usually, it was her house, and late at night... Unfortunately, it never got any further than passionate kissing. But, you know what? After a few months of these meetings, I realized that Eloise wasn’t just a <mark>fling</mark>, I wanted to be with her for real. This is the first girl, or rather woman, who I felt really good with.</p>

      <p>Unfortunately, Eloise herself still didn’t take me very seriously... it was <dfn data-inf="như thể">as if</dfn> she was waiting for someone else. And I didn't know what I needed to do to finally prove to her the seriousness of my <u title="(ns) ý định (ngày 13)">intentions</u> and finally start dating her openly. But then it <mark>dawned on</mark> me. Why date if I can marry her right away?! At that time, I was completely sure of my feelings, so I just started saving money for an engagement ring.</p>

      <p>The ring I bought wasn't the most expensive or the coolest (I'm no millionaire), but <u title="(gerund) việc cầu hôn">proposing</u> the right way was more important to me anyway. I wanted it to be big, so I went to her, right in middle of her class. With this gesture, I wanted to show her that the College administration was nothing compared to my love for her.</p>

      <p>I was wearing a suit, holding flowers, and a ring. So <u title="ngay sau khi (ngày 90)">once</u> she, and everyone present, noticed me, I started my <u title="(n) lời nói trang trọng<br>(lời cầu hôn) (ngày 58)">speech</u>. I think it went well. It seemed like any girl would've said "Yes" afterward.</p>

      <p>But... something happened that I, for some reason, didn't really expect. When I got down on my knee in front of her, she got scared and just walked away from me. I went to her and knelt down again, but she ran away from me again. I was in shock, so I just repeated this <u title="(n) quy trình (ngày 9)">procedure</u> a few more times, but she still ran away from me. You can probably imagine how <u title="(adj) khốn khổ (ngày 115)">miserable</u> I was to watch. I wasn't going to try to figure things out in a room full of students.</p>

      <p>After Eloise's reaction to my proposal, I literally just ran out of the building. I didn't know how to react...</p>

      <p>I went home and started telling myself that she didn't like me, and maybe she had someone else, you know. And even though she called me many times, I ignored her.</p>

      <p>The next day, when I went to my classes, I, along with Eloise, was immediately called to the <mark>dean</mark>'s office (couldn't ignore her for that long). <u title="(ns) những lời đồn, đàm tiếu (ngày 223)">Rumors</u> about the <u title="(n) sự cố cầu hôn (ngày 74 + 195)">proposal incident</u> had already reached the <u title="(n) quản lý (nhà trường) (ngày 102)">administration</u>. And it turned out that relationships between teachers and students are completely <u title="(p2) bị cấm">forbidden</u>... it was way worse than I thought. It was only then that I finally realized what Eloise was afraid of. If I admitted that there was something between us, she'd be fired. Thank God I realized this and <mark>got it together</mark> before the meeting. I <mark>reassured</mark> them that I was just a <mark>fool</mark> who had a huge crush on his teacher. I was <u title="(adj) tạo được sự thuyết phục (ngày 115)">convincing</u> and it worked. Of course, they had a conversation with me and asked me not to do it again, but, thankfully, Eloise's position at the College was saved.</p>

      <p>I was so eager to make the proposal surprising and unexpected that I forgot to think about the <u title="(ns) những hậu quả có thể xảy ra (ngày 15 + 152)">potential consequences</u>. She never really told me what would happen if a teacher dates a student, and for some reason, I thought that no one would <u title="bị trừng phạt (ngày 147)">be punished</u>. So yeah. I'm an idiot.</p>

      <p>After talking to the dean, Eloise and I went elsewhere to finally discuss everything properly. She was understandably mad at me, but she still said yes to my proposal! I couldn't believe my luck at that moment. We kissed very passionately, too bad we were in a college building.</p>

      <p>She later <u title="(v-ed) làm rõ (ngày 56)">clarified</u> that we would only get married once I finished college, and until then, our relationship will stay the same. That wasn’t okay with me. It was way too long before I was going to graduate. I thought that if we <u title="(v-ed) hoãn lại (ngày 43)">postponed</u> our marriage and kept meeting secretly at her place, well, there was a chance that it wouldn't happen at all.</p>

      <p>So once again, I decided to take action. I thought about it for a couple of days, but I still gave college up without telling anyone. Of course, I went to share this happy news with Eloise right away, but she didn't think it was happy news at all. Instead, she <u title="(v-ed) năn nỉ (ngày 275)">insisted</u> that I go back because, without proper education, the chances of finding a <u title="(adj) danh tiếng, danh giá (ngày 202)">prestigious</u> job are much lower. She also said that no matter how much she loved me, she didn't want to live with a future low-life.</p>

      <p>We had a big fight. After all, as I saw it, she didn't believe in me, she didn't believe that I could succeed without a college education. And I was upset that I had done this for her, and she didn't even <u title="(v) cảm kích (ngày 84)">appreciate</u> it. This was our first <u title="(adj) to (ngày 1)">major</u> fight, and we barely spoke for about two weeks.</p> 

      <p>There was no college anymore, but I <u title="(v-ed) giả bộ (ngày 143)">pretended</u> to go there for my parents, and instead, I really went to work. They didn't know anything until I finally got tired of hiding the truth. I was tired of leaving the house in the morning, so I told them about my relationship with Eloise and how I <u title="(-ed) đã bỏ học">dropped out</u> of college for her. It was predictable that they'd be angry, but I still hoped that they would understand.</p>

      <p>But they started <u title="(v-ing) quát nạt (ngày 131)">yelling</u> and <u title="(v-ing) yêu cầu (ngày 121)">demanding</u> that I go back to College. And I couldn't do that, because I really wanted to <u title="làm lành (ngày 154)">make up</u> with Eloise and start a family with her. This wasn’t a good enough excuse for my parents, and they gave me an <u title="tối hậu thư - lời đe dọa/cảnh báo đưa ra những điều kiện buộc đối phương phải chấp nhận, thi hành theo, nếu không sẽ dùng những biện pháp quyết liệt (ngày 229)">ultimatum</u>. Either College, a roof over my head, and a job at dad's firm, or nothing and Eloise. Do I need to even say what I chose?</p>

      <p>I gathered my things and went to my loved one. Many people live on their own when they're younger than me, so the fact that I <u title="bị đuổi/tống cổ khỏi nhà (ngày 299)">was kicked out</u> at 20 years old wasn't that scary. My greatest fear was that Eloise wouldn't accept me. But her love for me wouldn’t let that happen. In the end, she realized that I left College <mark>for the sake of</mark> our relationship.</p>

      <p>My dad fired me, so I had to work as a cashier at a small diner. It didn't matter, though, because, at the time, the main thing was that Eloise and I were finally together. After a while, we got married. <u title="Không có gì hoa mỹ, cầu kì (ngày 267)">Nothing fancy</u>, just a visit to a <mark>justice of the peace</mark>, but we were still happy. Unfortunately, it didn't last for very long.</p>

      <p>A couple of months after we got married, she went from being, and I kinda hate saying it this way, but, "the hotter, older woman" to just an old woman. The magic of our forbidden relationship was gone. <mark>Long story short</mark>, I fell out of love with her as quickly as I fell in love with her.</p>

      <p>As you can imagine, after a while, Eloise and I got divorced. I returned to live with my parents and I'm currently preparing to go back to College. So that was the story. Finally, let me give you some advice. Think about it a thousand times before you get married - and after you do - make a thousand and one. Bye!</p>
