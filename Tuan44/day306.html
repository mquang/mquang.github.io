      <p>Hello there! My name is Mike. When I was 19 I found one million bucks <u title="(adv) thực sự luôn (nhấn mạnh sự thật, tính đúng đắn) (ngày 168)">literally</u> on the ground. But, unfortunately, in the end I lost more than I found.</p>

      <p>I study journalism at college and last fall I attended a creative writing <u title="(n) buổi hội thảo (ngày 184)">workshop</u> in New York. On my way home I was waiting for my train at the station and noticed something strange — a small black box lying near a coffee machine. I looked closer and opened the box. It was an <u title="(n) nhẫn đính hôn (ngày 138)">engagement ring</u> with a huge stone! For some reason I was sure that the ring was a fake. So I had no problem with taking that find as a <mark>souvenir</mark> from New York for my girlfriend Amanda.</p>

      <p>I arrived back at my <u title="(n) khuôn viên trường (ngày 90)">college campus</u>. But before giving that ring to Amanda I decided to take it to an <mark>appraiser</mark> at the local <dfn data-inf="(n) tiệm trang sức">jewelry shop</dfn>. You know… <mark>just in case</mark>. An old respectable gentleman examined the stone with some special equipment. And when he saw the <mark>engraving</mark> he was completely shocked… It was a real diamond! I had found a 14-carat diamond ring at the railway station… It cost around $998,000.</p>

      <p>The appraiser <u title="(v-ed) nghi ngờ (ngày 276)">suspected</u> me of <u title="(gerund) ăn cắp (ngày 118)">stealing</u> it, but I told him the truth. We contacted the <u title="(n) công ty bảo hiểm">insurance company</u> and <u title="(v-ed) xác định (ngày 172)">determined</u> the original buyer. His name was Johan. He was a <u title="(adj) bí ẩn (ngày 124)">mysterious</u> rich guy from Europe who had <u title="(v-ed) thừa hưởng, thừa kế (ngày 290)">inherited</u> his <u title="(n) gia sản, gia tài (ngày 231)">wealth</u>. The insurance company came and took the ring in order to deliver it safely.</p>

      <p>On my way home I had very mixed feelings...</p> 

      <p>Later that night I was having dinner with Amanda. Suddenly, I received a FaceTime call from unknown number. I thought it was the insurance company, but it was Johan himself! He was standing in front of a <u title="bữa tiệc đắt đỏ, đắt tiền (ngày 267)">fancy party</u> and sounded a little drunk… He wanted to thank me <u title="gặp mặt trực tiếp (ngày 154)">in person</u> for saving his engagement ring and invited me to <u title="đến nhà chơi (ngày 281)">come over</u> to Venice right away! Amanda cried: “Hey! What about me?” When Johan noticed Amanda, he invited her too. In addition, he promised to <u title="(v) lo đủ (các chi phí) (ngày 70)">cover</u> all of our <u title="(ns) các chi phí (ngày 7)">expenses</u>!</p> 

      <p>It was very <u title="(adj) hấp dẫn (ngày 293)">enticing</u>. You know… Visiting Europe has always been <u title="vượt quá, ngoài tầm (ngày 190)">beyond</u> my <u title="(n) ngân quỹ (ngày 75)">budget</u>. So of course we agreed to go!</p>

      <p>In about a week, Johan’s <mark>bodyguard</mark> Jeff arrived at our college campus in a luxury car and took us to the airport. We had a <mark>first class</mark> flight. I've never seen Amanda so excited. She was asking me to take her picture like every 5 seconds!</p>

      <p>In Venice Jeff took us to a five star hotel. The receptionist welcomed us as if we were a royal couple. Even the bathroom itself in our <mark>suite</mark> cost more than my entire life! Jeff invited us to have coffee with the boss and warned us that Johan had become a little <mark>eccentric</mark> since he lost his mom, dad and brother several years ago.</p>

      <p>We entered a nice restaurant with a <u title="(n) sân hiên, sân thượng (ngoài trời) (ngày 247)">terrace</u>. And there he was! With his perfect smile, violet jacket, and white <mark>loafers</mark>. He was explaining to the chef that his Panna Cotta was not as <u title="(adj) (hàng) thật, chính hãng (ngày 73)">authentic</u> as it could be.</p>

      <p>I introduced myself and Amanda and shook his hand. Johan was quite the <mark>talker</mark>! But I didn't mind and just enjoyed my gelato. In the middle of our lunch, a <u title="(adj) vô cùng xinh đẹp (ngày 73)">stunning</u> woman interrupted us. It was Isabella — Johan’s <u title="(n) vợ sắp cưới">fiancée</u>. She jumped on his <mark>lap</mark>, kissed him, and asked “who are they and why are they dressed like that?” Amanda got very confused and I didn't know what to say…</p>

      <p>Johan introduced us as his <mark>dear</mark> guests and asked Isabella to take Amanda shopping to prepare for the <mark>yacht</mark> party scheduled for the evening. So, the ladies left and I was left alone with Johan. He gave me an envelope with money to express his <u title="(n) sự biết ơn (ngày 5)">gratitude</u>. He <u title="(n-ed) năn nỉ (ngày 275)">insisted</u> that I should take it, before I even tried to <u title="(v) từ chối (ngày 217)">object</u>!</p>

      <p>I thought, why not? It never hurts to have a little extra cash.</p>

      <p>When I arrived back to the hotel room, I carefully counted the money and it was $10,000! I put it in the safe and prepared to take the best bath of my life, but suddenly Jeff knocked on the door. He brought several outfits for me to try on. I said that I could go to the party in my jeans and T-shirt, but Jeff said that that <mark>was out of the question</mark>.</p>

      <p>Amanda was gone all day and when she arrived I could <mark>barely</mark> recognize her. Her natural brown hair had become blonde, she had beautiful evening makeup on, and a red carpet <mark>gown</mark>.</p>

      <p>We arrived to the yacht and it was even bigger than I had imagined. Johan noticed that my <mark>bow tie</mark> was <u title="(n) trong tình trạng bừa, lệch lạc, lôi thôi (ngày 113)">a mess</u> and invited me to his private cabin to help me with it. He told me that he was going to propose to Isabella that night. And as his brand new “guardian angel,” I had to be present! His hands were shaking. He was afraid that Isabella might <u title="(v) từ chối (ngày 42)">reject</u> him, which was <mark>ridiculous</mark>! I mean… I had only known this guy for one day and I already wanted to marry him!</p>

      <p>The party was awesome. I was dancing with Amanda and enjoying <mark>gourmet</mark> snacks. Then I got a little lost looking for a <u title="(n) nhà vệ sinh (ngày 294)">bathroom</u> and saw something interesting. Isabella was kissing some stranger in the corner. They didn't see me and <u title="(v-ed) lẻn vào (quietly) (ngày 236)">snuck into</u> a cabin. I stepped closer to listen to their conversation. But they weren't talking a lot… if you know what I mean… The only thing I learned from that "<u title="(n) do thám, (bí mật) theo dõi (ngày 234)">spy</u> mission" was the name of her lover — Sebastian.</p>

      <p>I didn't know what to do. Johan was going to <u title="(v) cầu hôn (ngày 74)">propose</u> to Isabella in 20 minutes! I found Amanda. She told me to tell Johan <u title="(adj) ngay (ngày 53)">immediately</u>. So I told Johan and he got <u title="(adj) điên tiết (ngày 212)">furious</u>! He grabbed a bottle of whiskey and disappeared into the crowd.</p>

      <p>After 20 minutes, the music became <mark>solemn</mark> and everyone was asked to <u title="(v) tập trung (ngày 197)">gather</u> on the <u title="(n) boong tàu (ngày 267)">deck</u>. Johan stepped onto the stage and <mark>howled</mark>: “Isabella! Come over here!”</p>

      <p>Isabella appeared from the crowd in all her <mark>glory</mark>. Johan fell on his knees in front of her like a Drama Queen and opened the box with the ring. He said: “Honey, today I was gonna propose to you with this ring. But! An angel <u title="(v-ed) thì thầm (ngày 211)">whispered</u> to me that you’re sleeping with my business partner. So I should probably just give this ring away to someone else.”</p>

      <p>Then he put the box into Amanda’s hand and approached Sebastian. Isabella tried to calm Johan down, but he <u title="(v-ed) tóm lấy (ngày 176)">grabbed</u> Sebastian and threw him overboard. At that moment the fireworks <dfn data-inf="được bắn">were launched</dfn>, which made the situation even more <mark>ridiculous</mark>.</p>

      <p>Everyone was <mark>scrambling</mark> on the deck, trying to pull the <mark>backstabber</mark> out of the water. Meanwhile, I congratulated my girlfriend for earning a million bucks just for being in the right place at the right time! I was a little <u title="(adj) ghen tị (ngày 154)">jealous</u> though.</p>

      <p>Johan asked his guests to leave and we spent <u title="khoảng thời gian còn lại của buổi tối hôm đó (ngày 155)">the rest of the evening</u> with him. He <u title="(v-ed) ép (ngày 127)">forced</u> me to play chess with him and smoke cigars, like an adult. And then my girlfriend and I had a great night in our hotel room.</p>

      <p>The next morning, Johan invited us for breakfast and suggested going to his villa in Sicily. He wasn't ready to <mark>part with us</mark> and he needed <mark>moral support</mark>.</p>

      <p>I really wanted to see his villa. Amanda was very excited too! So yeah! We spent two more days in Venice going to all the main <u title="(ns) các địa điểm du lịch (ngày 83)">tourist spots</u> and then went to Sicily on a boat with Johan and the <mark>ever-present</mark> Jeff of course.</p>

      <p>His villa looked amazing: it had a <mark>winery</mark>, <mark>cellars</mark>, and a huge swimming pool. I felt like a complete loser in comparison with all this luxury. Meanwhile Amanda was obviously having the time of her life.</p>

      <p>One night Johan invited his friends for a pool party. A <mark>sultry</mark> woman named Francesca, who was in her 30-s, was <u title="(v-ing) đeo đuổi (ngày 145)">chasing</u> me all night, despite the fact that she arrived with her husband. She <u title="năn nỉ">insisted on</u> apply<u>ing</u> <mark>lotion</mark> to my <mark>tender skin</mark>. That was awkward.</p>

      <p>After dinner things got worse. Useful fact: rich people also play “truth or dare”… When it was my turn to do a “dare” Johan told me to kiss Francesca! So, I kissed her and it wasn't disgusting. But Amanda wasn't jealous at all for some reason.</p>

      <p>When everyone went to play <u title="bi-a (ngày 267)">billiards</u>, Francesca took me for a walk. She <u title="(v-ed) gợi ý (ngày 38)">hinted</u> that she was in open relationship with her husband and tried to kiss me again. I explained that Amanda was my girlfriend. But Francesca laughed and asked: “Are you sure?” That <u title="làm tôi bực, tức (ngày 224)">pissed me off</u>!</p>

      <p>I went to sleep early, but I couldn't sleep all night. Amanda returned from the party at 4 a.m…</p>

      <p>The next morning I suggested that we go back to the USA. But Amanda <mark>protested</mark>. Johan had already promised to show her a bunch of beautiful places on the island. She didn't wanna miss the opportunity to advance her Instagram posts. Well... I just gave up.</p>

      <p>Later that night Jeff drove the three of us to a beautiful rocky beach. The walk was beautiful, but stressful, because I had to <mark>watch over</mark> Amanda who was taking videos and pictures the whole way. And I had to watch Johan who was drunk and <mark>stumbling</mark> the entire time.</p> 

      <p>After swimming I fell asleep on the beach. When I woke up my skin was on fire! And nobody had woken me up! Amanda was posing in her swimsuit by the <mark>shore</mark> and Johan was taking pictures.</p>

      <p>I <u title="(v-ed) bò (ngày 170)">crawled</u> into a <u title="(adj) râm mát (ngày 299)">shady</u> beach bar. When Johan and Amanda returned to me, she showed me all of her pictures and it was only then that she noticed that I looked like a lobster. They took my poor body to the villa and put me to bed.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile Johan and Amanda left for an art exhibition without me. But Johan invited Francesca to come and <mark>brighten up</mark> my loneliness. She jumped into my bed and we watched a movie. She cooled my skin with her cocktail glass and it felt like heaven. Nothing happened between us, but we fell asleep in the same bed.</p>

      <p>When Amanda returned she cried: “What the heck?” Francesca grabbed her bag, said goodbye, and left. I tried to explain myself but Amanda didn't listen. She decided to go sleep downstairs.</p>

      <p>In the middle of the night I decided to go and talk to her. I checked everywhere. No Amanda. No Johan. And finally I found them kissing by the pool. I got very mad! I threw the phone at Johan’s head, but he <mark>dodged</mark>, and the phone landed in the pool. Amanda was trying to save her phone while Johan was trying to calm me down. But I ran away, because I didn't want them to see me crying.</p>

      <p>My skin was still hurting and I decided to continue the scandal the next day. But in the morning Jeff told me that Johan and Amanda had left for Switzerland. He provided me with an airplane ticket to the USA and an even bigger envelope of money… I refused to take them and left that awful place as soon as I got better.</p>

      <p>As for Amanda, after a week she texted me that she was going to stay with Johan and thanked me for introducing her to the love of her life.</p>
