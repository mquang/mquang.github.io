      <p>Mary: Did you work while you were at university?</p>

      <p>Martin: When didn't I work while I was at university? It was <u title="">ridiculous</u>, yeah. You have to sort of <mark>supplement</mark> your income while you're at university, so you can afford to pay for books.</p>

      <p>Mary: Well, see, I mean, some people studied and worked at the same time where I'm from. And then some of my friends actually said they performed better during semesters when they had a job because they had to practice good time management. I didn't really work very much during university. I worked during the summers, full-time, and saved money, and <u title="">occasionally</u> (worked) on weekends. I think (I worked) one weekend a month or something. And I wasn't the best at managing my time. It was like, "I had all this time to do it. Oh, it's not <u title="">due</u> for two weeks. I'll do it later." But the people who had to work were like, "Oh, I have three hours. I better get started right now." But can you <u title="">take loans out</u>?</p>

      <p>Martin: We can, yeah. It's not as expensive as it is in the US, to my knowledge. We can take a small loan, so we have to supplement our income through part-time jobs, working in a restaurant or in a <u title="">convenience store</u>, because university is quite expensive. It's about $40,000 for us for the four year period. So if you don't have parents who can afford to <mark>stump up</mark> that bill for you, then it kind of <mark>falls on</mark> yourself.</p>

      <p>Mary: Right. The laws are changing in America <u title="">regarding</u> loans, but when I was in school, the government would let people just <mark>rack up</mark> these huge debts, so they'd be entering the workforce with $60-100,000, sometimes, <u title="">owed</u> to the government.</p>

      <p>Martin: That's ridiculous. How can you afford to, then, work and pay that money back?</p>

      <p>Mary: They're pretty <mark>generous</mark> about letting you pay it back slowly, but I just wouldn't want that <mark>hanging over my head</mark>.</p>

      <p>Martin: Nope, not at all.</p>
