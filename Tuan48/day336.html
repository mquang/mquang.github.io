      <p>Hello there! My name is Page. Few years ago I <u title="đã phản bội (ngày 260)">betrayed</u> my sister and I’m not proud of it. But trust me - what she did to me and my kids was much worse…</p>

      <p>At the age of 20, I found myself <u title="ở trong hoàn cảnh mà mọi thứ đều rất tệ hại (ngày 117)">in a desperate situation</u>. I was an unemployed single mother with my 2-year-old daughter named Alice living in an <u title="(đồ) không dùng, bỏ đi (ngày 25)">abandoned</u> trailer… How did this happen? Easily! Step one — fall in love and marry a <mark>selfish</mark> <dfn data-inf="(n) tên khốn">jerk</dfn> and <u title="(n) gã nghiện cờ bạc">gambler</u>. Step two — wait just a little bit… And <mark>voila</mark>! When Alice was only 10 months old, my husband Oliver told me that he needed more space and we divorced… Then he just disappeared and left me to deal with his <u title="các khoản nợ (ngày 126)">debts</u> and <dfn data-inf="(adj) đáng sợ, rùng&#10;rợn">creepy</dfn> <mark>moneylenders</mark>…</p>

      <p>After a while, our landlord <u title="đuổi, tống cổ (ngày 299)">kicked us out</u> on the street and I lost my job. I didn't have any friends, because we had just moved to that town… Fortunately, my neighbor had a trailer. I was allowed to stay there for a little while. I could not even afford to buy food for Alice… The situation got <u title="nghiêm trọng, nguy kịch (ngày 52)">critical</u> and I called my only living relative — my older sister Kitty. We haven't talked to each other for 5 years <u title="khoảng (ngày 260)">or so</u>. She has always treated me like a <mark>redneck</mark>. She was 38 years old and lived in Denver with her husband Karl.</p> 

      <p>Fortunately, Kitty got very excited and bought me a ticket to Denver. A handsome guy in his 40's met me and Alice at the airport. It was the first time I'd met Karl… He prepared a special car seat and a toy for Alice, which was very <mark>touching</mark>. When we arrived at their home, Kitty was barbecuing in the backyard. She organized a party to introduce her cute little <dfn data-inf="đứa cháu gái">niece</dfn> to all her friends and neighbors. Everybody asked embarrassing questions about my past, but Karl shut them up. He said that Alice and I could stay at their home for as long as we wanted. Kitty didn't seem happy about this, but she still <u title="gật đầu đồng ý (ngày 218)">nodded</u>…</p>

      <p>During the next three months, life gradually improved. Karl <mark>repaid</mark> all my debts and helped me to get a part-time job online… Kitty enjoyed spending time with Alice. She bought her a bunch of cute dresses and toys… And then one day, Kitty took Alice to a playground without even telling me. I was running all over the house and neighborhood in a <u title="cơn hoảng loạn (ngày 292)">panic</u>, because Kitty didn't pick up the phone. After two hours, my hair turned gray and I was ready to call the police. But Kitty brought Alice back, as if everything was completely OK! I yelled at her and told her to ask me before taking my child away. But Kitty began to cry. And Alice joined her.</p>

      <p>When I finally managed to calm them down, Kitty <u title="thú nhận (ngày 151)">confessed</u> that she was <mark>infertile</mark>. Karl had dreamed about having a big family and she felt useless… I hugged Kitty and asked her about <u title="việc nhận nuôi (ngày 210)">adoption</u>, but she pushed me away. She yelled, saying that I was <mark>selfish</mark> and <u title="ác độc (ngày 120)">cruel</u>. This was the first time when I noticed something weird about her behavior.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Karl was getting more and more attached to Alice… and to me too. We had so much in common and we talked a lot. Kitty was very <u title="ghen tuông (ngày 154)">jealous</u>, even though I never allowed myself to <u title="tà lưa (ngày 207)">flirt</u> with him.</p>

      <p>One day, I was doing laundry. Suddenly, Kitty grabbed my shoulders and <u title="thì thầm (vào tai) (ngày 211)">whispered</u> that I should avoid talking to her husband, if I wanted to stay in their house. <u title="đúng ra là (ngày 140)">Technically</u>, it was his house, but still… I was very scared and followed her <u title="những lời chỉ dẫn, nhắc nhở (ngày 92)">instructions</u>. But when Karl left for a business trip, things got crazy…</p>

      <p>It was my birthday and Kitty had prepared a gift. She sent me to a spa hotel overnight and promised to <u title="trông, chăm sóc (ngày 87)">look after</u> Alice. You know… because I deserved to treat myself and take a break from <mark>motherhood</mark>… Well, that trip almost <mark>cost</mark> me my motherhood! I got my hair and nails done, enjoyed a massage, and finally relaxed. But when I returned home, I found Kitty holding Alice in her arms. She was talking to a police officer and social worker in the living room. I asked: “What happened?” and tried to hug Alice. But the social worker — Trisha — invited me to have a tense personal conversation… At the office, I was shaking and crying. I tried to explain that my sister had promised to take care of my baby. But <u title="theo như lời (ngày 22)">according to</u> Kitty, she'd spent the entire weekend outside the city and when she came back home, she found a hungry and <u title="bị thờ ơ, bỏ rơi (ngày 272)">neglected</u> Alice on the floor… Can you believe that? Kitty lied and said that I had neglected my 2-year old child for 24 hours! In addition, Kitty told them that I had raised Alice without a father on the street… Trisha warned me that I could lose my <mark>parental rights</mark>, if the situation was repeated. And my sister had a really good chance of getting <mark>custody</mark>…</p>

      <p>I finally realized what Kitty was trying to do… I called Karl and yelled that I would fight for my daughter. Karl seemed very confused… He had nothing to do with Kitty’s <mark>hustle</mark>. He asked me to wait for him to get back and to avoid any drama. When I returned home that night, Kitty was acting in a very <u title="bằng mặt mà không bằng lòng">passive-aggressive</u> manner. She put Alice to sleep, sang her a song, and didn't say a word to me. Since that day, I began to take Alice with me everywhere I went.</p>

      <p>One morning, we went to get groceries. When I was picking out fruit, Alice let go of my hand and ran away. I followed her but it seemed like she just disappeared. I was running all over the supermarket yelling her name. Suddenly I noticed Kitty outside. She was trying to put Alice in a <dfn data-inf="xe taxi">cab</dfn>… I ran up to them, <u title="giành lấy (ngày 176)">grabbed</u> my child, and started to yell at Kitty. Kitty told me that she was trying to protect Alice… That was enough for me… I realized that my sister was insane! I hurried home, packed our bags, and left to go live in a <u title="nhà nghỉ (ngày 331)">motel</u>.</p>

      <p>Later that night, Karl returned home from his business trip. He came over to support us. I gave him the address of the motel, because I trusted him. Karl told me that Kitty was <mark>overreacting</mark> because of her health issues. He promised to bring her to a <u title="bác sĩ chuyên khoa (ngày 220)">therapist</u>. When Alice fell asleep I hugged Karl to thank him for his help. Karl was very shy, like a little boy. He whispered that he loved me and that it was killing him… And honestly. I wasn’t surprised. I loved him too. But I still wasn't ready to <u title="thừa nhận (ngày 135)">admit</u> it. So, I asked him to leave me alone… But he <u title="năn nỉ (ngày 275)">insisted</u> on taking care of me and Alice no matter what…</p>

      <p>During the next six months, I just worked from home and raised my daughter with a calm heart. Karl helped me to rent an apartment and provided monthly payments for child support. I met new friends and Karl visited us from time to time. As for Kitty, she was ignoring me and she never answered my calls … One day, Karl told me that they had gotten divorced. Kitty refused to visit her therapist and their relationship just <u title="tan vỡ (ngày 150)">fell apart</u>… He told me that he still loved me. I gave up <u title="giả bộ (ngày 143)">pretending</u> that he was just a friend and we began to date.</p>

      <p>Soon after that we moved in together… It was <mark>selfish</mark>, but I felt like I had finally found my soulmate. When we learned that I was <u title="có thai (ngày 141)">pregnant</u>, Karl <u title="đã cầu hôn (ngày 74)">proposed</u> to me. We invited several friends to celebrate our wedding in a nice hotel in the countryside. Alice looked like a little angel and my friend Sarah agreed take care of her, so that Karl and I could have our perfect wedding night together. Karl carried me in his arms into the hotel room and laid me on the bed. We began to kiss and undress, but suddenly I felt something weird… like a large animal was <u title="đang bò (ngày 170)">crawling</u> under the bed. Nope! It was Kitty. She got out from under the bed and asked us why we didn’t invite her… We didn't tell her about the wedding <u title="chủ định (ngày 92)">on purpose</u>, but unfortunately Karl's mother had <mark>blabbed</mark> to her. Kitty had lied to the hotel staff, saying that she was preparing a romantic surprise for her sister and they gave her the key to the <u title="phòng cao cấp ở khách sạn cho cặp đôi nghỉ tuần trăng mật (ngày 163 + 303)">honeymoon suite</u> ... Kitty was very drunk and <u title="trông đau khổ, khổ sở (ngày 115)">miserable</u>, her makeup was <mark>smeared</mark>… I didn't know what to say.</p>

      <p>But then Kitty noticed my <u title="bụng bầu (ngày 228)">pregnant belly</u>… she began to yell at Karl and run all over the room, tearing up the wedding decorations. Then she tried to attack me, but Karl grabbed her. I didn't want her to harm herself or others, so I called the police and doctors, and they forced her to leave. That was the least romantic night of my life…</p>

      <p>When I <u title="sinh ra (ngày 174)">gave birth to</u> Willy, Karl was in seventh heaven. Meanwhile, Kitty was trying to apologize for what happened at the wedding. She texted me saying that she was very drunk and upset. She began to send me flowers and gifts for the baby, but I sent all of them back. I was too afraid to let her close to the family after she had tried to <u title="bắt cóc (ngày 275)">kidnap</u> Alice…</p>

      <p>In six months, a very unexpected guest knocked on our door. It was my ex — Oliver. He told me and Karl that Kitty had found him and offered him money to <u title="">kidnap</u> our kids. Oliver is the meanest man in the Universe, but that deal was too much, even for him. That’s why he came to warn us. We asked him to provide evidence to the police to obtain an <mark>injunction</mark> and protect the kids. But, unfortunately, Oliver had his own personal reasons for wanting to avoid the police. Karl and I decided to pay a visit to Kitty. She was acting very friendly and said that she couldn't wait to meet her nephew… I freaked out and asked her about Oliver. Kitty denied everything and laughed.</p>

      <p>After that <u title="sự cố (ngày 195)">incident</u>, Karl and I sold the house and relocated to a new city. And I wish I could say that we lived happily ever after. But last Christmas we woke up in the middle of the night because someone had broken into our house… And it was not Santa… It was Kitty… wearing a <u title="trang phục ông già Noel (ngày 88)">Santa costume</u>. We heard sounds from the living room and went downstairs. The entire room was covered with black <mark>mud</mark>. Kitty was holding Willy in her arms, singing Christmas songs and laughing, while Alice was playing nearby.</p> 

      <p>Kitty noticed me and yelled that someone was a bad bad girl and deserved tons of coal… Karl had already called the police. Suddenly, Kitty grabbed Karl and kissed him on the lips… She called him her husband, and Willy — her son… Karl was trying to kill time until the police arrived. They took Kitty for a <u title="kiểm tra tâm thần">psychiatric examination</u>. Today, my sister is <mark>undergoing</mark> treatment at a mental hospital. She has <dfn data-inf="tâm thần phân liệt">schizophrenia</dfn>. I visit her <u title="thi thoảng (ngày 88)">on a regular basis</u>, but she <u title="gần như không (ngày 304)">barely</u> <u title="nhận ra (ngày 55)">recognizes</u> me. Kitty couldn’t <u title="giải quyết, đương đầu (ngày 113)">cope with</u> the <mark>bitterness</mark> about her inability to give birth. She created an imaginary world, in which she had two kids with her loving husband Karl, and I never existed… Of course, I feel very sorry and <dfn data-inf="cảm thấy tội lỗi">guilty</dfn>. But at the same time — I’m glad that my kids are safe now. I hope she gets better someday.</p>
