      <p>- So tell me about yourself.</p>

<p>- I um....</p>

<p>- So, tell me about yourself.</p>

<p>- Well, I...I like...</p>

<p>- Hmm. So tell me about yourself.</p>

<p>- Can I call a friend?</p>

<p>You <u title="(v-ed) nộp (hồ sơ) (ngày 99)">submitted</u> the <u title="(n) hồ sơ ứng tuyển (ngày 28)">résumé</u> and you waited and you waited <u title="(adv) 1 cách kiên nhẫn, kiên trì (ngày 101)">patiently</u> and finally, you got that phone call, and now you got the interview. You're sitting <u title="(preposition) đối diện (ngày 64)">across</u> the table and the <u title="(n) người quản lý việc tuyển dụng (ngày 25 + 99)">hiring manager</u> smiles and asks you the question...</p>

<p>Tell me about yourself.</p>

<p>And you <mark>panic</mark>. And you don't know what to do. You don't know what to say. You start to <mark>stutter</mark>. And <mark>halfway through the conversation</mark> you say to yourself, "Ugh! <mark>I blew it</mark>! Why did I even say that?!" You never get a second chance to make a <u title="ấn tượng ban đầu (ngày 82)">first impression</u>. Usually that hiring manager makes up his or her mind in the first three minutes during the interview. Do you make a good impression? So today I'm going to share with you from a CEO <u title="(n) góc nhìn (ngày 124)">perspective</u>, from a hiring manager perspective, from an employer perspective, what is the best response to the question "tell me about yourself."</p>

<p>You see, we have interviewed thousands and thousands of <u title="(adj) tiềm năng (ngày 152)">potential</u> <u title="(ns) người ứng tuyển (ngày 24)">applicants</u> and I cannot tell you how many times I see people kind of <u title="(v) chật vật (ngày 263)">struggle</u> with this question but however, there are <u title="(ns) những sự cố (ngày 195)">incidents</u> that we are very impressed with the response. This is not <dfn data-inf="(n) giả thuyết">theory</dfn>. We have taken some of the best replies, some of the best responses to this question. I'm going to teach it to you, and by the end of this video you're going to walk away with the exact <u title="(n) công thức (ngày 178)">formula</u>, exactly what do you need to say and how to say it. I'm also going to give you a little <u title="(n) kịch bản (mẫu) (ngày 177)">script</u>, a little template, so next time when you are asked this question you know exactly what to say.</p>

<p>And now let me give you a couple keys first. Key number one. When the hiring manager is asking you the question "tell me about yourself" they are not actually asking about your whole life story. They're not asking about your parents, your background, and your dog's name, and what kind of cat do you have. It is not about that. So when people hear that question, they think, "Oh, let me tell you my life story!" and twenty minutes into it, you have not talked about anything important.</p>

<p>So, what they're actually asking is what are you bringing to the table. So from now on, when you hear the question, "tell me about yourself" I want you to make the mental switch. That equals what value could you bring to the company? What problems can you solve for the company? That's what they are asking. And you shouldn't go on and on and on about all your background and all of that. No. Don't do that.</p>

<p>Key number two. Be yourself, but be your best self. See, one of the mistakes people make here is they believe in the interview, "well, I just want to be myself". Yes, you want to be yourself, but you want to be your best self. You want to be <u title="(adj) (hàng) thật => là con người thật (không phải diễn, giả tạo) (ngày 73)">authentic</u>, you don't want to be fake. But it doesn't mean that you just share everything. This is the first time you just sitting across the table from a hiring manager, it's like a date. Right? You're just getting to know each other. This is like a coffee date. So make sure that you present your best self. Lead with your strong foot forward. So when they are asking you the question, everything you share, any statement that you make, you always want to tie it back to what's in it for them. W-I-I-F-M. What's in it for them?</p>

<p>So let me give you an example. Let's say someone is hiring and you're applying for a social media manager position. And the hiring manager is asking you, "well, so tell me about yourself." A typical response, someone might say, "well, you know, I um, I-I-I grew up with social media and, um, I've used social media for a long long time, my whole life actually. So I'<u title="(phrase) hiểu biết, có kinh nghiệm (ngày 289)">m very familiar with</u> it. And just about three years ago, I thought to myself well, maybe I could actually make a living doing this. So I started playing around with it, and, um, take on a couple clients here and there and I've worked with a couple people, uh, and then, now, you know, I'm planning to get married and my <u title="(n) chồng sắp cưới (ngày 226)">fiancé</u> told me, you know, I should get a <u title="(adj) ổn định (ngày 261)">stable</u> job. So here I am, and, I'm looking for a company that offers good growth <u title="">potential</u>, good growth opportunity. And this place is not too far from my home. It's good, it's only a ten minute drive."</p>

<p>You see the problem? Like this, all me me me me me me me me me me me. It's all about that person, what they need and all of that stuff. Bad idea.</p>

<p>Now, how do you feel if you are the hiring manager when you ask that question, comment below, if that's the answer that you get.</p>

<p>So, instead of <mark>rambling on</mark> about that, about my background and all this stuff, what I want, no. If you turn it into a <u title="(n) lợi ích (ngày 84)">benefit</u>, what's in it for them, what's in it for the hiring manager. What could you say? I'm going to give you a simple formula. Write this down. Three S. Three S. </p>

<p>First, success. Now here's a script that you could use. "I have been blank". Or, "my background is blank". So, let me <u title="(v) làm rõ, giải thích (ngày 56)">demonstrate</u>. Let's say it's the same position, social media manager, that you're applying. First, success. I have been. I have been doing social media for the last three years and I <u title="chuyên sâu về mảng (ngày 18)">specialize in</u> helping companies and entrepreneurs growing their Facebook fan page. And in the last three years alone I have helped dozens of clients in over ten different industries. And on average I've been able to help my clients to really increase their engagement and grow their fan page by three to five hundred percent in less than six months. And that's what I am passionate about. In fact I have listed some of those clients that I've worked with on the reference letter. You see how that works? You're talking about your success but without <u title="nổ, khoe khoang, nói phách (ngày 219)">bragging</u>. It's more to demonstrate and showcase your skillset. What are you good at?</p>

<p>That's that number one, success. And then, step number two is strength. And here's the script. "My strength is" or "my real strength is" fill in the blank. My real strength is my ability to truly understand what your audience wants. I <mark>pride myself on</mark> my <u title="(n) danh tiếng, tiếng tốt (ngày 150)">reputation</u> to creating <mark>engaging</mark> and <mark>compelling</mark> content that I know your audience loves and wants to share. That's the second step. My strength is blank.</p>

<p>Third, situation. Meaning, how does that apply to the position that you're applying. How do you apply your background, your strength into the new company, the new opportunity. Situation, "what I am looking for is". "What I am looking for is ...", fill in the blank. What I'm looking for is a company that I could add value to, that I could produce a positive return on investment for. Where I could join a strong team. Is this what ABC company is looking for? You see? At the end you ask a question. Whoever asks a question controls the conversation. So you want to ask a question. And now the hiring manager will be like "okay, yeah, I guess that's what I'm looking for", or "no that's not what we're looking for". And you got from there. Just because you are in an interview it doesn't mean that you don't need to sell.</p>

<p>The next question you might have is well, Dan, does that mean that I have to memorize a script of some sort? And the answer is absolutely yes. You don't want to go in unprepared. In fact, you want to write it out, practice it, <u title="(v) diễn tập, tập dượt, nhẩm lại (ngày 207)">rehearse</u> it many many times. So when you are in front of that potential hiring manager, you are ready to go. You need to memorize it and say it many many times and repeat it many many times so it <mark>comes across</mark> very very natural.</p>

<p>The last thing you want is to panic and stutter and you don't know what to say. You do not want to do that.</p>
