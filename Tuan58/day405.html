          <p>Presenter: You will hear a woman called Anne Smith talking to a small group of people who are starting their first day of work at a travel agency.

</p><p>Anne Smith: OK everyone, let’s get this meeting started. My name’s Anne Smith, and for all of you, this is your first day at Star Travel Agency. It’s great to have you here. Um, the person who I think did your job interviews was Melissa Bennett. She’s our Branch Manager, and you’ll see her around, but she mainly deals with the large tour groups. I deal with smaller groups, or families or independent travellers. And that’s what you’ll be doing too. So my main responsibility is to look after and train new employees like yourself, anyone who hasn’t yet had much experience of working in a travel agency, and help you work with those kinds of customers.

</p><p>Working for Star Travel Agency is something I hope you’ll really enjoy. The salary isn’t bad, compared to other travel agencies, that is. But what I like most is the fact that everyone who works here is always very kind and very happy to help. You’ll be working with a great group of colleagues. And later on, when you’ve had a bit more experience, you may have the chance to go abroad and visit some of the destinations we send our customers to.

</p><p>After our morning coffee break, you’ll be given some training that I hope you’ll find useful. Um, for training in how to use the software, we’re going to get you working one on one with an experienced member of staff – and that person will show you how to use it properly. It takes a while to get used to – so ask lots of questions if you need to. And that person will also show you how to answer calls when customers <u title="(ph.v) gọi điện đến (ngày 179)">ring up</u> and want you to organise a holiday or flight for them. But after that, you’ll all come together as a group again, and it’ll be me who explains how to make suggestions to your customers when they know they want a holiday, but they just aren’t sure where to go. Or perhaps they have a general idea, but they want you to come up with some specific advice.

</p><p>There are lots of skills you need for this job. <u title="">Paying close attention</u> to what your customers are saying is probably the main one. It might sound obvious, but if they’re telling you that they want a quiet, <u title="(adj) yên bình, tĩnh lặng (ngày 238)">restful</u> experience, then there’s no point sending them to a noisy tourist resort. They won’t be happy, and then the company will have to deal with a complaint. Then it’s also necessary that you can express yourself clearly to some of our foreign customers. Don’t <u title="(v) giục, thúc giục (ngày 209)">rush</u> the booking, and take time to explain things carefully.

</p><p>So, let me mention a few other people that work here, and who you’ll probably meet. So, for example, the person who’s responsible for making sure you get paid <u title="">on time</u>, and that it’s the correct amount, that’s Andrew Brown. So any problem, go and see him. Julia Summers does <u title="">help him out</u> from time to time, but she mainly deals with company accounts, and our financial planning for the year. I think the company website still says that Joe Ramsay is the person responsible for salary payments, but he actually left the company a couple of months ago. We must update those details, sorry. Now …</p>
