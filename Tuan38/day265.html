      <p>Vanessa: The next topic is jobs. I want to know what was your worst job ever.</p>

    <p>Dan: Worst job ever?</p>

    <p>Vanessa: Yeah.</p>

    <p>Dan: Well, I have two <u title="cạnh tranh (ngày 19)<br>=> phân vân, khó lựa chọn">competing</u> jobs.</p>

    <p>Vanessa: Hopefully it's not your current job,
    making English lessons.</p>

    <p>Dan: It's video editing and doing these videos.</p>

    <p>Vanessa: Oh, no.</p>

    <p>Dan: I can't stand working with my wife. Just kidding. It's the best. Yeah. So yeah, really my worst job, if I had to pick just one, it would be being a dishwasher.</p>

    <p>Vanessa: Oh, okay.</p>

    <p>Dan: Now notice, there's no differentiation between the machine, a dishwasher, and the person who is a dishwasher, it's the same word.</p>

    <p>Vanessa: So you were like the machine, you were washing dishes.</p>

    <p>Dan: Yeah. I mean, you did have a machine, so you'd have something on the side you'd slide the dishes in and all that, but it's just, I was also like, I think I was 16 at the time, an adult and I had no friends in the restaurant. They were all older and they were all really <u title="cục súc (ngày 195)">tough</u>. I don't know, in America, when you... the kitchens <u title="có tiếng">have a reputation</u> for having really kind of tough kitchen cooks, and they all... they <u title="chửi thề, chửi rủa (ngày 131)">swear</u> a lot, and they make <mark>foul</mark> jokes-</p>

    <p>Vanessa: They've had a lot of life experiences.</p>

    <p>Dan: ... and I was just like a little Christian 16 year old kid, washing dishes in the corner, trying to look like relatively normal. But I didn't talk to anybody-</p>

    <p>Vanessa: And you were <u title="được dạy, giáo dục tại nhà thay vì đến trường lớp (ngày 125)">homeschooled</u>. Yeah, no experiences.</p>

    <p>Dan: Yeah, well at that time I was in high school.</p>

    <p>Vanessa: Oh, yeah, yeah.</p>

    <p>Dan: But it was a small, <u title="trường tư">private school</u>. Anyway-</p>

    <p>Vanessa: You were very different from the other people.</p>

    <p>Dan: ... not only was that really awkward, it was also bad because washing dishes just kind of <mark>stinks</mark>. You just get all the dishes, and some of the guys used to make fun that I wasn't going fast enough. One guy said, "Dan, you have two speeds, slow and stop."</p>

    <p>Vanessa: You're like a turtle?</p>

    <p>Dan: Yeah, I'm like a turtle.</p>

    <p>Vanessa: Well, sometimes I still say that.</p>

    <p>Dan: I wasn't fast enough, and another time I reached into the <mark>mucky</mark>, dirty water and I cut my finger on a broken glass and I was bleeding in the water.</p>

    <p>Vanessa: Oh. Things you don't want to know when you visit a restaurant.</p>

    <p>Dan: And I was <mark>paid under the table</mark>.</p>

    <p>Vanessa: Oh, really?</p>

    <p>Dan: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>

    <p>Vanessa: Why'd they have to pay you under the table?</p>

    <p>Dan: I don't know, because it's an Italian restaurant-</p>

    <p>Vanessa: Because you were too young?</p>

    <p>Dan: ... in <mark>rural</mark> Pennsylvania.</p>

    <p>Vanessa: They didn't want to pay taxes on their employees or something?</p>

    <p>Dan: Yeah.</p>

    <p>Vanessa: Oh.</p>

    <p>Dan: Plus who wants to pay taxes on a dishwasher?</p>

    <p>Vanessa: I wonder if it was because you were 16, like was there an age limit?</p>

    <p>Dan: I might have even been 15 at the time.</p>

    <p>Vanessa: Okay, maybe you were under the legal age that they could hire someone-</p>

    <p>Dan: Could be.</p>

    <p>Vanessa: ... so they just paid you under the table.</p>

    <p>Dan: Yeah, so that was pretty bad.</p>

    <p>Vanessa: That sounds pretty bad.</p>

    <p>Dan: Yeah, it was an awkward job.</p>

    <p>Vanessa: Especially as a first job, it just seems uncomfortable.</p>

    <p>Dan: That was my second job. Yeah.</p>

    <p>Vanessa: Yeah. Well-</p>

    <p>Dan: How about you?</p>

    <p>Vanessa: ... I feel like-</p>

    <p>Dan: Could it beat that?</p>

    <p>Vanessa: Well, I feel like my worst job wasn't bad because of the social situation like yours, it was bad because it was so boring. I worked for a summer at this office, I was like a <u title="nhân viên mùa vụ, tạm thời (ngày 9)">temporary employee</u> just for the summer, working kind of like a <mark>call center</mark> job. But every day they gave us these <u title="những kịch bản (ngày 177)">scripts</u> and we had to call companies who maybe this company bought a printer within the last couple months.</p>

    <p>Dan: I'm bored just listening about it.</p>

    <p>Vanessa: Yeah, and I called the company and said company and said, "Oh, I saw that you recently bought the HP Inkjet printer, and we have a <dfn data-inf="sắp tới">upcoming</dfn> <u title="buổi đào tạo (ngày 66)">training session</u> on this day. Would you like to <u title="tham dự (ngày 13)">attend</u> the training session about this printer?"</p>

    <p>Dan: She does have a really good call voice, though.</p>

    <p>Vanessa: And I called so many companies again and again, talking with secretaries, talking with other people, just saying, "Do you want to go to this <u title="buổi chuyên đề (ngày 184)">seminar</u> about..." some electronic device that they had recently bought.</p>

    <p>Dan: If you called me, I'd be like, "Yeah, I do. Can I buy more?"</p>

    <p>Vanessa: Well, people were generally nice to me, it was just... it wasn't a subject that I was interested in, it wasn't something I was trained to do, so I didn't feel like it was my <dfn data-inf="chuyên môn">specialty</dfn>, it was just a temporary job to make money.</p>

    <p>Dan: And you were sitting in an office all day, right?</p>

    <p>Vanessa: Yeah, it was my first office job.</p>

    <p>Dan: Vanessa doesn't like to sit very long.</p>

    <p>Vanessa: No, I have to go, go, go, like we talked about. So sitting in that office desk, it was just not my thing. But the office, on the other hand, did really try to make it interesting for the employees, because they knew most of the people I worked with were in a similar position as me, where it wasn't their life-long dream to work in that job. So about once a week, we had these game show competitions-</p>

    <p>Dan: That sounds fun.</p>

    <p>Vanessa: ... where at lunch, during the lunch break, everyone would go to the lunchroom, if you wanted to of course, and they had these competitions kind of like Wheel of Fortune, or Jeopardy, and the company just had them for the employees. Sometimes we had dress up days where we <u title="hóa trang (ngày 158)">dressed up</u> like cowboys, or dressed up like... they were trying to make it interesting.</p>

    <p>Dan: Come on, this is better than being a dishwasher.</p>

    <p>Vanessa: It's probably better than being a dishwasher, but I just felt like they were trying so hard to keep employees-</p>

    <p>Dan: To make it interesting.</p>

    <p>Vanessa: ... to make it interesting-</p>

    <p>Dan: All right.</p>

    <p>Vanessa: ... because they knew this is not an interesting job.</p>

    <p>Dan: Yeah, can I say my second worst job?</p>

    <p>Vanessa: Oh, yeah. Sure.</p>

    <p>Dan: Can you guess what it is?</p>

    <p>Vanessa: I know you worked at a lot of coffee shops, but those weren't that bad.</p>

    <p>Dan: Working at a coffee shop is good. It's fun.</p>

    <p>Vanessa: Okay, well what was it?</p>

    <p>Dan: It's the sharpshooter.</p>

    <p>Vanessa: Oh, can you explain about that job?</p>

    <p>Dan: Yeah, so I don't know if you've ever seen this in your country, but have you ever been to a place where somebody takes your picture, and then later they try to sell you that picture? I was that guy. So we took the same pictures, it was going onto a boat on one of the rivers in Pittsburgh.</p>

    <p>Vanessa: So it was kind of like a cruise boat, but a <u title="tham quan, du ngoạn trên sông (ngày 168)">river cruise</u>.</p>

    <p>Dan: Yeah, kind of. It was very kitschy though, like not <mark>high class</mark> at all. So people, before they got on the boat, we forced them to stop and go through the line, and we'd take their picture. And it was required, but people were like, "I don't want to get my picture taken."</p>

    <p>Vanessa: And everyone had their own cameras and phones.</p>

    <p>Dan: And this is... Yeah. Mind you, this is in like 2010, where people already have phones on their cameras and stuff. I mean, that's at least getting more popular.</p>

    <p>Vanessa: Yeah, they didn't need your picture.</p>

    <p>Dan: No. So I had to take everybody's picture, and then when they got off the boat, I stood at the side and said, "Hey, come over here, buy this picture." And they were like $20 for one picture.</p>

    <p>Vanessa: Crazy.</p>

    <p>Dan: A terrible <mark>rip-off</mark>, even I knew it was a terrible rip-off, just not a <mark>worthwhile</mark> business, at least in 2010 when I was doing that job.</p>

    <p>Vanessa: Yeah, maybe 10 years before that it would have been cool.</p>

    <p>Dan: Yeah, it was a <mark>viable</mark> business like 30 years ago.</p>

    <p>Vanessa: But not now.</p>

    <p>Dan: Yeah, but not any more. That was really bad, and one time somebody stole one of my pictures and I actually got fired from that job.</p>

    <p>Vanessa: Because they stole a picture.</p>

    <p>Dan: Because they stole a picture and I couldn't... I didn't catch them on time, and I was like, "<mark>Good riddance</mark>."</p>

    <p>Vanessa: Yeah, "Goodbye to this job. Goodbye forever."</p>

    <p>Dan: Yeah. The only reason this was better than the other job, than dish washing, is because I worked with some people who were funny and we <dfn data-inf="hoà hợp">got along</dfn> pretty well.</p>

    <p>Vanessa: And you were outside, you were by the river.</p>

    <p>Dan: It was okay.</p>

    <p>Vanessa: Except you did have to drive an hour to get there, that's crazy.</p>

    <p>Dan: I did drive an hour to work.</p>

    <p>Vanessa: You should never drive an hour to get to a part-time job.</p>

    <p>Dan: But that was my fault, I wanted to work in Pittsburgh, and I still lived... did I live with my parents?</p>

    <p>Vanessa: Yeah, I think so.</p>

    <p>Dan: I think I did. I wasn't an adult yet.</p>

    <p>Vanessa: Oh. Oh. All right. Well, I'm <u title="tò mò (ngày 203)">curious</u> for you, what is the worst job that you've ever had? Let us know. And let's go to the next topic.</p>
