      <p>Vanessa: The next topic is childhood. I want to know when do you think childhood ends, and when do you become an adult?</p>

  <p>Dan: When does childhood end?</p>

  <p>Vanessa: This is a deep question.</p>

  <p>Dan: Well, I don't think it can be a <u title="cụ thể (ngày 17)">specific</u> age, I think it's different for everyone. I think it's at any point you can leave this house of your parents and live on your own, <u title="tự biết chăm sóc bản thân">take care of yourself</u>, and you're not <u title="phụ thuộc, lệ thuộc (ngày 173)">dependent on</u> somebody else. Like if you're living with your friends and <mark>bumming off</mark> them, you're probably not an adult yet. So if I had to pick an age, I'd probably say 16.</p>

  <p>Vanessa: Oh.</p>

  <p>Dan: Yeah, I'm saying kind of young.</p>

  <p>Vanessa: Okay.</p>

  <p>Dan: In an <mark>ideal</mark> world, I think a 16 year old should be ready.</p>

  <p>Vanessa: Okay. Okay. I get it. At 16 were you ready?</p>

  <p>Dan: No, of course not.</p>

  <p>Vanessa: <mark>Ideally</mark>.</p>

  <p>Dan: Ideally, yeah. I don't think our society prepares us to be ready at 16. It prepares you to be ready at 18.</p>

  <p>Vanessa: Or later.</p>

  <p>Dan: Right, or later. But you know, in an ideal world I think you could be ready at 16, but it's a kind of complicated world now, so maybe 18 is an acceptable age.</p>

  <p>Vanessa: I feel like, for me, I have less ideas about childhood ending and adulthood starting that are physical. I feel like it has more to do with making your own decisions. There might be a lot of reasons why you have to live at home, or you have to be dependent on someone else, but if you are making your own decisions you are not a child, you're an adult. And I'm sure as our children get older and become teenagers, that's going to be a little bit harder for us to make that line for someone else, but I know for myself-</p>

  <p>Dan: Well, this is-</p>

  <p>Vanessa: ... making more decisions.</p>

  <p>Dan: ... <u title="Nghĩ rằng (ngày 171)">assuming</u> you are <mark>capable</mark> as a person to live on your own, of course.</p>

  <p>Vanessa: Yeah. Yeah, I think you can still be an adult just making your own decisions, but we still need help from other people as adults, so there's a... it's a <mark>gray area</mark>.</p>

  <p>Dan: Sure. Yeah. I would-</p>

  <p>Vanessa: Yeah, it's not so clear.</p>

  <p>Dan: ... also add, I don't know, for myself personally, having children really makes you an adult. It doesn't have to be true for everyone, but I think it's easier for some people to just kind of be really selfish, and do their own thing, and kind of live like a kid, especially nowadays because we have so much entertainment, you could just watch TV every day. A lot of guys I know play video games a lot, and I'm not <mark>knocking</mark> on video games but playing video games every day is a good way to remain a child, <mark>at heart</mark> anyways.</p>

  <p>Vanessa: Sure.</p>

  <p>Dan: This is my opinion, it's a little <mark>judgemental</mark>, but-</p>

  <p>Vanessa: Yeah, I think if you are a good person, and you have a child, then you feel forced to be become an adult.</p>

  <p>Dan: Yes.</p>

  <p>Vanessa: There's still bad people who have kids, who remain children themselves-</p>

  <p>Dan: That's true.</p>

  <p>Vanessa: ... and then they're bad parents. But I think if you're generally a good person, when you have kids, it's kind of a shock.</p>

  <p>Dan: Yeah, well-</p>

  <p>Vanessa: Like, "Whoa, this child is so dependent on me. I need to be responsible. I have to organize myself <u title="1 cách nào đó (ngày 180)">somehow</u>." You have to change.</p>

  <p>Dan: ... I think being an adult, part of it is having a burden of responsibility of some kind, whether it's a job, or your house payments, or whatever it is. Some people add those <u title="gánh nặng (ngày 197)">burdens</u> of responsibility anyways without children, but I don't know, for me, it's just different. Like, "This is the person I'm taking care of in my life." People now-</p>


  <p>Vanessa: Yeah.</p>

  <p>Dan: ... because we've got two.</p>

  <p>Vanessa: Well, two coming up soon. So I have a question for you, when do you think childhood ends? When does adulthood start? It's going to be different for every culture, too because this is a pretty cultural specific question. Maybe in the U.S.-</p>

  <p>Dan: Yeah, maybe you have a-</p>

  <p>Vanessa: ... it's different than your country.</p>

  <p>Dan: ... maybe you have a <mark>rite of passage</mark> in your country.</p>

  <p>Vanessa: Oh, can you explain what a rite of passage is? Because that's kind of a <mark>nuanced</mark> thing.</p>

  <p>Dan: Yeah, a rite of passage is something that every boy or every girl does to become an adult.</p>

  <p>Vanessa: Oh, like some ceremony, or activity.</p>

  <p>Dan: Yeah, like a ceremony. Yeah, I mean, we don't really have this in the U.S., some people say college is a rite of passage, but not... I mean, more and more, almost everybody goes to college now.</p>

  <p>Vanessa: A lot of people do, but-</p>

  <p>Dan: Yeah, so it kind of is, but it's a really bad one because usually people just go, and they have parties, and they live really irresponsibly.</p>

  <p>Vanessa: It's not a way to become a responsible adult.</p>

  <p>Dan: Yeah, and then you do more school.</p>

  <p>Vanessa: Ah, yes.</p>

  <p>Dan: It's not really becoming a man.</p>

  <p>Vanessa: Changing your life completely. Yeah. So I'm <u title="tò mò (ngày 203)">curious</u>, in your country is there something that <mark>signifies</mark>, "Now you are an adult.", this kind of rite of passage ceremony, or festivity, or party that you have. In the U.S. we don't really have that, but I think it's kind of a cool idea that you're celebrating-</p>

  <p>Dan: I wish we did.</p>

  <p>Vanessa: ... this big change, going from childhood to adulthood, and it is a <mark>gray area</mark>, at least in the U.S. it's a really gray area, so it's nice to celebrate that as parents, that your kids are adults, hopefully. And that as a child, "Oh, great, now I'm an adult. Society sees me as an adult." So I think it's kind of a cool idea, but maybe it's something we can do with our future kids. All right, let's go onto the next topic.</p>
