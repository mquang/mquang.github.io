      <p>STUDENT: Hi, Professor Timmons? Do you have a few minutes? I was hoping to talk about what I missed on Thursday.</p>
	<p>PROFESSOR: Hello, come in. Sure, sit down. Could you tell me your name please?</p>
	<p>STUDENT: Margaret, sir. Margaret Parkinson. I apologise for missing your class but I had to go to the hospital.</p>
	<p>PROFESSOR: I'm sorry to hear that! Everything is OK now though, I hope?</p>
	<p>STUDENT: Yes, thanks.</p>
	<p>PROFESSOR: Glad to hear it. So on Thursday I outlined the research project that will <mark>account for</mark> 30% of your grade. All students will be divided into groups and will give a well-researched presentation to the class covering a <u title="ngày 17">specific</u> topic <u title="ngày 104">relevant</u> to student life.</p>
	<p>STUDENT: Oh, that sounds interesting - can we choose just any topic that <mark>pertains to</mark> life as a student, like how to start your own student organisation?</p>
	<p>PROFESSOR: Well, though I'm sure that would be an informative presentation, I have already chosen a list of topics which I will <u title="ngày 106">assign</u>. As an example, I assigned one group the topic of student <u title="ngày 104">loans</u>. They <mark>are to research</mark> not just the <mark>prevalence</mark> of students who have loans to pay for their <u title="ngày 90">tuition</u>, but information as to how best to manage these loans and possible <u title="ngày 90">scholarships</u> that could <mark>alleviate</mark> some of the <u title="ngày 93">financial</u> <mark>burden</mark>.</p>
	<p>STUDENT: That one sounds particularly interesting to me - could I request that topic? I could easily find out a lot about it by stopping by the Finance Office on my way to class.</p>
	<p>PROFESSOR: Unfortunately, that one is already taken by another group. I have, however assigned you to a group and given you all one of two choices.</p>
	<p>STUDENT: Oh, I see. What are the choices?</p>
	<p>PROFESSOR: The first is discussing smoking. Trends in the number of student smokers compared with the general population, popular reasons students <mark>take up</mark> smoking, and more healthy <u title="ngày 186">alternatives</u> to smoking.</p>
	<p>STUDENT: Hm, that one could be interesting. I'm not a smoker myself, but will see what my group thinks. If we did choose this topic, we would rather not put our <mark>fellow</mark> students on the spot to interview them - where else could we <mark>gather</mark> information?</p>
	<p>PROFESSOR: How about where the cigarettes are sold?</p>
	<p>STUDENT: Oh, that's a great idea. I could interview the manager of a supermarket and find out the average age of people buying cigarettes, or how much they buy, that sort of thing?</p>
	<p>PROFESSOR: <u title="ngày 166">Precisely</u>.</p>
	<p>STUDENT: Okay, I'll keep that in mind. And what was the other topic?</p>
	<p>PROFESSOR: The other topic is the practice of natural medicine. It sounds far more specific than the others, but it is more an exercise of outlining a career path. If your group chooses this, you would cover the specifics of becoming a Doctor of Natural Medicine, how to become licensed to practice natural medicine, what the career <mark>outlook</mark> is, etc. you could find much of the information you need on this in the Careers Office.</p>
	<p>STUDENT: Wow, that would be really helpful not just in learning about natural medicine, but in how to approach researching any career path.</p>
	<p>PROFESSOR: That's the idea. I want groups to really think outside the box to find information on their topics. They should interview multiple sources.</p>
	<p>STUDENT: Okay, now I think I have the general idea.</p>
	<p>STUDENT: When is the presentation <mark>due</mark>?</p>
	<p>PROFESSOR: I expect each group to send me an email attachment of the plan <u title="ngày 172">ahead of time</u> - by October 10th - so that I can <u title="ngày 21">ensure</u> that you are on the right track.</p>
	<p>STUDENT: Oh, that's actually really reassuring. I would hate to spend so much time on a presentation only to find we had taken it in the wrong direction! So when is the presentation?</p>
	<p>PROFESSOR: I let groups choose from the list of <mark>time slots</mark> I have between November 1st and November 5th.</p>
	<p>STUDENT: Okay, how about the 3rd? I'll have to check with my group, of course, but maybe we could write a <mark>tentative</mark> time?</p>
	<p>PROFESSOR: Sure, let me take a look. I'm actually booked completely through the 3rd and 4th now. How about sometime in the afternoon of the 5th?</p>
	<p>STUDENT: Great! How about 2 o'clock?</p>
	<p>PROFESSOR: No problem. I'll pencil your group in.</p>
	<p>STUDENT: Okay, thanks. And to <u title="ngày 56">clarify</u>, what exactly is due in the first <mark>phase</mark>?</p>
	<p>PROFESSOR: Before the October deadline, I want your group to have <mark>compiled</mark> resources and then to provide some <u title="ngày 105">initial</u> data <mark>analysis</mark> to support your claims.</p>
	<p>STUDENT: Okay, so data analysis is due the 10th of October, and then the um, the -</p>
	<p>PROFESSOR: - Presentation? Yes. The final phase is simply giving the presentation on the 5th of November.</p>
	<p>STUDENT: Alright, I think I have all the information I need. Thanks!</p>
	<p>PROFESSOR: You're welcome. See you in class tomorrow.</p>
