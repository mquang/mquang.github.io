      <p>Hey, this is kinda like a part two video. I mean you don't have to have seen the part one video to understand what I talk about in this video. But I mean if you haven't watched part one, uh, you should.</p>
<p>So I used to work at Subway and to be honest about 80% of the customers were fine. Sometimes they would do something that would just personally <mark>annoy</mark> me, like ask for a meatball on flatbread. So don't feel too bad for me.</p>
<p>Like, sometimes people would ask me:</p>
<p>"Can I have a turkey with <mark>lettuce</mark>, tomatoes--"</p>
<p>Whoa whoa whoa whoa! Slow down! What kind of bread? <mark>Foot-long</mark> or six-inch? What kind of cheese? Is it <mark>toasted</mark>? THEN we'll talk about vegetables!</p>
<p>And every time someone brought in a list, there would always be something missing on it. Always! I never had someone come in with a complete list. I would ask someone, "What kind of cheese?" And they would say, "Agh, they didn't <u title="chỉ rõ, ghi rõ (là loại nào) (ngày 17)">specify</u>." Well then, if they didn't care enough to remember cheese, I guess they'll get <mark><u title="loại pho mát Thụy Sỹ">Swiss</u></mark>!</p>
<p>If anyone watching is currently working at a Subway, then feel free to use these tricks. If someone asked me, "Hmm, what kind of cheese do you recommend?" I would ALWAYS say provolone. Because it's the easiest cheese to pull apart with gloves on. Really, if anyone asked me what I recommended, I would just tell them the easiest thing for me to do. But even after I gave my <mark>insightful</mark> provolone cheese recommendation, sometimes people would still say, "Hmm, I'll take American." Why do you even ask me what cheese I would recommend if you're not gonna take it seriously?!</p>
<p>Another thing that would annoy me is when people would say the sandwich was "All done" But they didn't put any sauce on it. So I would ask, "Any sauce?" and then they would be like, "Oh yeah, Mayonnaise." OH! Why did you tell me it was all done IF IT WASN'T!</p>
<p>Also, the receipt machine at the store took like seven seconds to print out the <u title="biên lai xác nhận sau khi hoàn tất thanh toán (ngày 95)">receipt</u>. So it would be very <mark>awkward</mark> if I asked someone, "Do you want your receipt?" and then they would say, "Yes." And then we would just STARE... AT EACH OTHER... UNTIL... The receipt printed.</p>
<p>So what I did every time someone <mark>swiped their credit card</mark>, I would just stare off into space, and in my head, I would count to five and then I would ask, "Do you want your receipt?" And by the time they said yes, it was like magic! As soon as they said yes, BSSHHH, the receipt printed.</p>
<p>At Subway, you only work with one other person. So if someone got annoyed and said, "Lemme talk to your manager." I would just look at them and go, "Listen, I've been here the longest. The only other person in this store is a 16-year-old girl, and she technically isn't old enough to use the <mark>toaster</mark>. So, I'm probably your best bet. I'm the manager."</p>
<p>Like, do people think the manager will automatically take their side and give them free stuff? YES, actually they do think that because it happens all the time.</p>
<p>I would consider myself a pretty <u title="dễ tính, thoải mái (ngày 157)">laid-back</u> Subway employee. I didn't like to be <mark>stingy</mark> with people, even though I was <u title="không tuân theo, làm theo (công thức) (ngày 174)">disobeying</u> the Subway <mark>formula</mark> <u title="cố tình (ngày 92)">on purpose</u>.</p> 
<p>Oh, you want more than six olives on your foot-long? Pff, sure!</p>
<p>Here, have a FIFTH slice of cheese!</p>
<p>A dollar fifty for avocado? Pff, I'll charge you seventy-five cents buddy!</p>
<p>I probably shouldn't be saying these things, you know. In case this whole YouTube thing <mark>flops</mark> and I need a job. So I wasn't really "<mark>strict</mark>" on the rules. You know those fast food workers who are strict,</p>
<p>"No! We won't serve breakfast at 10:02! Get out!"</p>
<p>But being pretty laid back still didn't stop people from being annoying.</p>
<p>So this one person comes in and asks for two, foot-long, pastrami sandwiches. And pastrami is our most expensive sandwich. It's about $10 for a foot-long. And guys, the pastrami is super good, but I wouldn't pay for it. I mean it's good, yeah, but I'm not paying $10 for a foot-long. It's not worth it. So this guy, I make his two sandwiches. I <mark>ring them up</mark> and I say, "That'll be $20." And I guess he didn't look at the price of the sandwich on the menu, or he thought we still did the $5 foot-longs, because he said to me, "I <mark>ain't</mark> paying for that."</p>
<p>And this is when I was just starting out! I only had like, a week of experience, and after he said that, I responded, "Well, shoot, I guess you're not paying for it, I didn't know people could do that."</p>
<p>"Hey, I want this!" "Alright, that's $20" "Nah." "You don't want it?" "No I want it, I'm just not paying for it."</p>
<p>Ok no, but actually we did come up with a <u title="sự thỏa hiệp giữa đôi bên (ngày 46)">compromise</u>. He told me he had $12, so he ended up paying for one of the sandwiches, and I got to eat the other one. So it all <u title="khả quan (ngày 89)">worked out</u>.</p>
<p>So one time I was making a sandwich for a guy with a very heavy accent and he asks for onions on the side. <u title="Không thành vấn đề (ngày 110)">No big deal</u>! We had Sooubway put vegetables in little cups all the time. I actually got a soup cup, because the on the side cups are teeny-tiny and I started doing my thing. But then he says, "No! On the side." and I think, "Oh! He's getting a foot-long! He probably wants onions on half of it, but not the other. So I start putting onions on half the <mark>sub</mark>, but then again he says, "No! On the side!"</p>
<p>At this point, I don't know what this guy wants. So I ask him, "On the side of what?" and then he screams, "O N I O N S". And I never figured out what he was trying to say.</p>
<p>This one old gentleman asks for sauce to be put on his vegetables, and normally we put it on top of the sandwich with the meat. And I didn't know if I heard him correctly because I put the sauce on and closed the sandwich. So your sauce would've been in the same place either way!</p>
<p>One time, this woman tipped me and Correy $40. She wasn't annoying. I just wanted to <mark>sprinkle</mark> in some good customer stories.</p>
<p>Ok one time, this, uh, Native American person came in and, I don't know if <u title="việc đề cập (ngày 38)">mentioning</u> that was important to the story... He comes in and asks for five foot-long Tunas. Ok Tyler, just me and you lets do this! And then when we're all finished, we <mark>ring them up</mark> and we say, "Anything else?" and he says, "seven meatballs" What!? He wanted seven more sandwiches!</p>
<p>But James, you're Sooubway! You're supposed to make people sandwiches <u title="bất kể (ngày 100)">regardless of</u> how many they ask for.</p>
<p>Yeah I know, but the guy could've handled it differently. Normally for a <mark>platter</mark>, you have to <u title="gọi báo trước ít nhất 1 giờ">call in at least an hour ahead</u>, and that's only five foot-longs. This guy <u title="có thể gọi trước và bảo">could've called ahead and said</u>, "Hey, I'm getting twelve sandwiches so just, prepare yourselves... mentally." I mean we had so many customers waiting in line. No, we didn't that's a lie, it was only him. But still!</p>
<p>This one woman, I was making her sandwich and for vegetables, she asked for extra lettuce. So I put on a big <mark>handful</mark>, but then she asks for more. So I put more on, "more" I sprinkle some on.</p>
<p>M O R E!</p>
<p>"Uh, I won't be able to close the sandwich with any more lettuce." and she says, "That's fine." "Alright, extra lettuce it is."</p>
<p>So I ended up giving her an open sandwich with a mountain of lettuce. You know we do salads, right?</p>
<p>When I was little, I always thought if I was working at a store and someone tried to <mark>rob</mark> me, I wouldn't give them any money. But now it's like, "Pshh, I ain't <u title="mạo hiểm tính mạng (ngày 117)">risking my life</u> for Sooubway! Here take the cash register!" So thankfully I've never had someone pull a gun on me, but I have caught people <u title="ăn trộm (ngày 118)">stealing</u> from us.</p>
<p>I was making someone's sandwich and this one kid asks for just a water cup. So I gave it to him. So I go back to making a sandwich and I just hear the <mark>fuzzy</mark> soda sounds <u title="đang được lấy (ngày 29)">being dispensed</u>, And I look over, and the kid is putting soda in the cup! HE DIDN'T EVEN TRY TO HIDE IT! <u title="Khi tôi rót trộm soda ít nhất tôi cũng đợi nhân viên rời đi">When I put soda in a water cup I at least wait for the employees to go in the back</u>. But, I didn't even say anything. I was just like, "Alright, man."</p>
<p>This guy, I totally saw him take a bag of chips and he hid it under the counter so I couldn't see. So when I <mark>rang up</mark> his sandwich I asked, "Anything else?" and he said, "Nope." Alright, whatever.</p>
<p>Ok, last story. I was in the back playing some Clash of Clans, and we have a computer that shows what the cameras see, and I see this woman who was eating there, She reached over the counter and took three large cups and I did nothing to stop it.</p>
<p>You know, I'm the kind of person that's like, "The fast food employee is always right." Say if I was eating somewhere, and I ask for a chicken salad and they said, "We only have tuna salad." I'm the kind of person that's like, "Oh, well I guess I'm having the tuna salad then."</p>
<p>I think people need to realize that these fast food workers are actually people and not something for you to use to get a free sandwich. I did mean it when I said in the last video that everyone at some point should work in a fast food or retail job. It's  it's it's <mark>nuts</mark>! Ok, we're done.</p>
<p>Look, she's actually putting six olives on a foot-long. <u title="Một quả còn bị rơi ra chứ!">One of them even fell off</u>!</p>
