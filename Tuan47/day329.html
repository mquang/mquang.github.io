     <p>Hello there, my name is Megan. I’m 22. I’ve been dreaming about moving in together with someone special <u title="đã rất lâu rồi (ngày 117)">for ages</u>! Well… my dream came true, but unfortunately the apartment that we picked was full of <mark>skeletons in the closet</mark>. And I had to catch those skeletons on my own.</p>

      <p>One year ago, I moved to Boston with my boyfriend Oliver and our dog Sammy. I was excited to start my new life with my man in the big city. We hired a <u title="duyên dáng (ngày 118)">charming</u> <u title="người môi giới bất động sản (ngày 300)">realtor</u> — named Jessica, and she took us to <u title="săn lùng (ngày 271)">hunt</u> for a dream apartment. The first four options were <u title="tệ (ngày 113)">horrible</u>: small, dirty, dark, and noisy. But when I saw the fifth apartment, I fell in love! It was affordable and had a lovely spacious closet. We signed the contract that same day and <u title="chuyển vào nhà mới (ngày 299)">moved in</u>.</p>

      <p>While Oliver moved all of our stuff with the <u title="những người chuyển đồ thuê (ngày 299)">movers</u>, I had a little chat with our neighbor, Mia. She was a 27-year-old <mark>freelance writer</mark> who lived alone with lots of plants. When we <u title="tháo dỡ (ngày 137)">unpacked</u> our bags and boxes, Mia knocked on the door and brought a flower in a pot as a welcome gift. We invited her in for coffee and she gave us a lot of useful tips about the laundry room in the basement, the Wi-Fi, the garbage, and other things like that… Mia also said that I <mark>had great taste</mark> and suggested we go shopping together some day.</p>

      <p>The next month was like heaven. Oliver and I were getting used to living together in the big city. We found furniture and decor items at <u title="chợ trời (ngày 235)">flea markets</u> and decorated our little <mark>nest</mark>. Then one day I took Mia shopping and she was acting very weird… She <u title="khen ngợi (ngày 11)">complimented</u> me the whole time, which was annoying. When she suggested we buy the same clothes to look like twins, I thought it was a joke… But it wasn’t! The next morning I went for a run as usual, and Mia joined me, even though she wasn't invited. I wanted to tell her that I liked to run alone, but I <u title="ngần ngại (ngày 93)">hesitated</u>… And she began to join me every morning! On top of that, every time we went for a walk with Sammy, she would be waiting for us outside accidentally.</p>

      <p>One evening we invited friends and colleagues for a party and I didn't tell Mia <u title="chủ định (ngày 92)">on purpose</u>. I wanted to take a break from her. In the middle of the party, she texted me: “Hey, whatcha doin’?” I didn't wanna lie, so I just ignored the message. After 30 minutes, everyone smelled burning and saw smoke coming from the <u title="hành lang (ngày 96)">corridor</u> and Mia’s apartment. I was <u title="kinh hãi, sợ hãi (ngày 232)">terrified</u>! Thank God we had smoke alarms in the building! Oliver knocked on Mia’s door… She opened and apologized. It turned out that she had left a chicken to <mark>roast</mark> in the oven and fell asleep… But the smoke was very <u title="nồng nặc (ngày 48)">intense</u>, like she burned something plastic on purpose… Mia saw the guests and asked: “Oh, are you having a party?” Mia’s apartment needed to be <mark>aired out</mark> and Oliver, as a gentleman, told her to join the party… Her behavior was pretty normal and the evening was saved…</p>

      <p>Oliver and I left for our hometown for the Christmas holidays for two weeks. I warned Mia, brought her several plants, and asked her to plant them. When we returned and I went to Mia's to pick the plants up. When she opened the door, I saw that she had cut and <mark>dyed</mark> her hair to look exactly like me… Her clothes looked exactly like my clothes. Even the jewelry was similar to my style. The <u title="nội thất bên trong (ngày 160)">interior</u> of her apartment also changed, she painted her walls purple and decorated them with Moroccan <mark>rugs</mark>, just like I did. I took the plants and told her that I had to run… At the moment I realized that something was wrong with this girl…</p>

      <p>When I went for a walk with Sammy, she joined us, without <u title="sự cho phép (ngày 92)">permission</u>, as usual… I asked her to stop being so <u title="ám ảnh (ngày 120)">obsessive</u>… Mia <u title="giả bộ (ngày 143)">pretended</u> that she had no idea what I was talking about. And I <u title="quát nạt (ngày 131)">yelled at</u> her, saying that she was acting like a crazy person by trying to copy my style. After that short fight I blocked her number and began to ignore her when she knocked on our door.</p> 

      <p>And things got worse… Every day we would receive food deliveries that we didn't order and we had to explain that to the restaurants. Then we began to receive different items — I even got a call from a delivery service that wanted to bring us a grand piano... Oliver and I understood that it was Mia, but we didn't have any proof because the payment method was always cash. We went to the <u title="chủ nhà (ngày 98)">landlord</u> for a <u title="lời khuyên, sự tư vấn (ngày 23)">consultation</u>. Unfortunately Mia owned her apartment and he could not force her to move out. Then I told Oliver that we should move out, but we had signed a <u title="hợp đồng thuê nhà (ngày 25 + 46)">lease agreement</u> for one year and we didn't have money for relocation…</p> 

      <p>I should mention that Oliver and I hadn't really been <u title="hòa thuận (ngày 283)">getting along</u> that well <u title="dạo gần đây (ngày 96)">lately</u>. He <u title="bị">suffered from</u> <mark>insomnia</mark> and was stressed out because he couldn't focus on his work. I was stressed out too… We began to fight a lot and I didn't recognize my boyfriend anymore. After a while, Mia began to wake us up in the middle of the night with music and loud sounds. One day someone cut our internet cable. And we both knew who that someone was… I asked Oliver to go talk to Mia and <u title="đe dọa, cảnh cáo (ngày 176)">threaten</u> her with the police, if necessary. When Oliver returned he said that she had <u title="phủ nhận (ngày 42)">denied</u> everything…</p>

      <p>After a while, I received an anonymous letter and a package with some <u title="vải (ngày 295)">fabric</u>. The letter said that Oliver had been <u title="cắm sừng (ngày 147)">cheating on me</u> for several months. I took a closer look at the package and realized that someone had sent me Oliver's underwear… Don't worry, they were clean... In the evening, I asked him directly what was this all about. Oliver said that he <u title="thực sự (ngày 168)">literally</u> didn't have any extra energy for cheating on me, because I had <u title="hút hết (ngày 296)">sucked</u> all <dfn data-inf="niềm hạnh phúc">joy</dfn> out of him… He said he was unhappy with me. And I got very angry and kicked him out… Oliver wanted to take Sammy with him, but I wouldn't let him do that…</p>

      <p>While Oliver was loading his stuff in the taxi and yelling that I had never loved him, Mia opened the door and <mark>stuck out</mark> her <u title="tò mò (ngày 203)">curious</u> <u title="lén lút (ngày 236)">sneaky</u> face. She asked me whether I needed a friend… I yelled at her and <mark>slammed</mark> the door. That night Mia was quiet, but I couldn't sleep anyway... I was too upset.</p>

      <p>The next day I returned back from work and I realized that Sammy was gone! We lived on the first floor and the window was open… I <u title="hoảng loạn (ngày 292)">panicked</u> and ran all over the neighborhood trying to find him. I called Oliver, but he said he was on a business trip and couldn't help me with the search. I printed a missing dog poster and <u title="phân phát, rải đi (ngày 29)">distributed</u> it everywhere. But it seemed like Sammy had just disappeared… Part of me <u title="nghi ngờ (ngày 276)">suspected</u> Mia of <u title="ăn trộm (ngày 118)">stealing</u> my dog, another part suspected Oliver!</p>

      <p>Anyway, I was losing hope and <mark>cried my eyes out</mark>, but after three days Mia brought Sammy back. She said she had found him at the park. I was so glad to see Sammy, that for a second, I forgot that Mia was a weirdo and I hugged her. She <u title="cho là (ngày 261)">perceived</u> that as a sign of friendship and invited me for coffee, but I refused. And after that chat, things got creepy…</p>

      <p>When I returned home from work, I noticed that someone had moved my chairs. The next day, someone changed my bedsheets and <u title="làm bừa bộn (ngày 113)">messed up</u> my makeup items. When I found my shoes in the fridge and food in the bathroom I realized that I was going crazy… Or… someone was trying to <u title="thuyết phục (ngày 115)">convince</u> me that I was going crazy! But only Oliver still had a key to the apartment! I spent my last little bit of money on a <mark>locksmith</mark>. He changed the door lock and put bars on the windows…</p> 

      <p>However, on the next day my furniture was rearranged again... Only this time, someone left a lipstick message on my bathroom mirror. It said: “You are protected.” I <u title="hoảng loạn (ngày 142)">freaked out</u>! What would you do? Of course I called the police… While I was waiting, I decided to change. In the closet, I noticed that the order of my shoe boxes was different. And I felt a draft from the wall. I touched the wall and it <mark>shook</mark>. I couldn't believe it… There was a <mark>masked hole</mark> in the wall that led to Mia’s apartment! I entered the hole and <u title="kết quả cuối cùng, dẫn đến điểm cuối cùng ở (ngày 118)">ended up</u> in Mia’s closet. It was filled with garbage bags... my garbage bags! And the clothes that I thought I’d lost! Suddenly I heard sounds from her kitchen and I freaked out. Mia was home and she was <mark>coming for</mark> me... I had to get out of her apartment!</p>

      <p>I decided to wait for the police on the street. But in the corridor I <u title="tình cờ bắt gặp (ngày 151)">ran into</u> Mia. She had a backpack and looked like she was going to run away. She knew that I knew about the hole!… I blocked her way out and said that the police were coming… Sammy <mark>barked</mark> loudly at her. Mia panicked and jumped into the elevator. Of course! We had an emergency exit in the building. She could enter it from every floor…</p>

      <p>I remembered that our neighbors had to reset the elevator after the fire service alarm... And I <u title="nảy ra ý tưởng (ngày 128)">came up with</u> a genius plan! I <mark>activated</mark> the fire alarm, which made the lift go down to the first floor automatically. Mia was still inside the elevator. Sammy and I wouldn't allow her to get out. She was looking at me like an <u title="hung hăng (ngày 117)">aggressive</u> animal in <mark>cage</mark>, but she didn't say a word…</p> 

      <p>After three minutes the police finally arrived. They <u title="kiểm tra, thanh tra (ngày 26)">inspected</u> the apartment and the hole in the wall and took us to the police station. Officers called the landlord. He said he had no idea! The wall was fine when they checked the apartment before renting it to us… Mia confessed that she made the hole in the wall while we were away for the Christmas Holidays… Can you believe that? In three hours, Mia’s father arrived to the police station from another town. He was sure that his daughter was doing fine! I took him to her apartment and showed him all the creepy stuff that she was hiding… The police also found <mark>diaries</mark>, in which Mia called me her best friend. She was describing how she had stolen Sammy and how she wrote that letter with Oliver’s underpants, because “he didn't deserve me.” Mia thought that she was protecting me all that time… I felt <u title="thương hại (ngày 218)">pity</u> for her father, he was very surprised…</p>

      <p>The police took Mia in for a <mark>psychiatric</mark> <u title="kiểm tra (ngày 1)">examination</u> and figured out that she needed treatment. And a I got a <mark>restraining order</mark>, of course… Meanwhile, I received some <u title="bồi thường thiệt hại về tài chính (ngày 23 + 93)">financial compensation</u> from Mia’s father and used that money to move to another apartment. Oliver is still <u title="cố gắng, nỗ lực (ngày 13)">making attempts</u> to try and <mark>patch up</mark> our relationship. But I realized that I wanted to be alone… So now I live with Sammy in a beautiful place. But I cannot help myself... I check all my walls <u title="thi thoảng (ngày 88)">on a regular basis</u>… And don't talk to my neighbors. What about you? Are you sure that all your walls are real?</p>
