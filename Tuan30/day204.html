      <p>NARRATOR: This has to be the most <mark>epic</mark> tree house I have ever seen. Four stories high, <u title="ngày 176">surreal</u> architecture, and this amazing tree swing. There's even a tree growing out of the third floor, and what looks like a <mark>penthouse suite</mark> on top. I have to know where this is.</p> 
	  <p>It was <mark>curiosity</mark> that drew this guy to the tree house.</p>
	  <p>CHUCK SUTHERLAND: Hi, my name is Chuck Sutherland. I'm a geographer and a photographer. The <mark>minister</mark>'s tree house is in Crossville, Tennessee and is <mark>arguably</mark> the world's largest tree house. It's 97 feet tall and is supported by six different trees.</p>
	  <p>The tree house is well known to those who lived in the area, and I'd been hearing about it for some time, so I decided to see it <u title="ngày 202">first hand</u>.</p>
	  <p>NARRATOR: The tree that's <mark>poking out</mark> the third floor is actually the main support for the structure - an 80 foot tall white <mark>oak</mark> tree with a 12 foot <mark>diameter</mark> base.</p>
      <p>CHUCK SUTHERLAND: My first impression upon looking at the <mark>massive</mark> <mark>facade</mark> of this tree house was simply <mark>awe</mark>. It was obvious this took a lot of <mark>labor</mark> and a lot of time to make.</p>
      <p>NARRATOR: The tree house was named after the man who decided to build it - minister Horace Burgess. According to Horace, the idea for the tree house came to him in a vision while he was deep in <mark>prayer</mark> - a bit like Noah and his ark.</p>
      <p>It set him on a 14 year path to build the largest tree house in the world. But unfortunately the minister was no architect.</p>
      <p>CHUCK SUTHERLAND: It was also <mark>haphazard</mark>. There was no real plan to the construction. <mark>Admittedly</mark> though, that's what made it more fun. Doors wouldn't lead where you thought they would. Ladders and stairs were in unexpected places. There's a basketball goal in the central room, which also doubled as a church on Sundays.</p>
      <p>NARRATOR: All in all, the tree house has over 80 rooms, and that structure on the top is actually a <mark>bell tower</mark> equipped with <mark>repurposed</mark> oxygen tanks, which serve as <mark>bells</mark> that <mark>chime</mark> daily.</p>
      <p>It's <u title="ngày 162">quirky</u> touches like this and its random architecture that made Minister's tree house such a popular destination. Sadly, it's also what led to its <mark>demise</mark> in 2012.</p>
	  <p>CHUCK SUTHERLAND: It was absolutely a fire hazard and it was absolutely dangerous those are the things that made it fun and attracted people.</p>
      <p>It was the tree house's haphazard construction that <mark>ultimately</mark> led to it being close by the state of Tennessee's <mark>fire marshal</mark>.</p>
      <p>NARRATOR: To this day, the tree house remains closed. But over 2000 people have signed a <mark>petition</mark> to have Minister Burgess's labor of love reopened. But without the funds to fix it, it's possible no one will ever be allowed to set foot inside this forest mansion again.</p>
