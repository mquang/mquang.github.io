      <p>Hi, Lucy, thanks for <mark>coming over</mark>! You're looking great! <mark>Come on in</mark>!</p>
    <p>Hi, Melanie! Sorry for <mark>turning up</mark> so late!</p>
    <p>It's fine, don't worry about it! Welcome to my apartment!</p>
    <p>It looks amazing, thanks for <mark>inviting me over</mark>! I love the furniture!</p>
    <p>The furniture was here when I <dfn data-inf="chuyển đến">moved in</dfn>! <mark>Sit down</mark> and make yourself comfortable.</p>
    <p>Thanks!</p>
    <p>Would you like something to drink? I have diet coke, fruit juice, and coffee.</p>
    <p>A diet coke, please.</p>
    <p>So please tell me, how are you <u title="bắt đầu (ngày 108)">getting on with</u> your life as a college student?</p>
    <p>Well, in the beginning, it was hard for me to <mark>fit in</mark>. I <mark>grew up</mark> in a small town, I <u title="quen với (ngày 10)">was not used to</u> living in a big city. I didn't even have any friends and I felt pretty lonely. It was hard for me to <mark>hang in there</mark>. But things have changed for the better. I've finally made a few good friends to <u title="tụ tập bạn bè tán ngẫu, chém gió (ngày 139)">hang out</u> with.</p>
    <p>That's great to hear! What's a typical day in your life like?</p>
    <p>Well, I <mark>wake up</mark> at 7 am. I go to the bathroom, wash my face and brush my teeth. I <u title="tập thể dục (ngày 89)">work out</u> every morning. I can't do without it! Before exercising, I usually like to <mark>warm up</mark> by doing <u title="các bài tập vươn vai, giãn cơ (ngày 161)">stretches</u>. Then I take a shower and after that I have breakfast. Next, I <mark>write down</mark> my to-do list for the day. I always <mark>plan</mark> my day <mark>ahead</mark>. I have a strict schedule and I do my best to <mark>stick to</mark> it. Then I check the weather, because I like to be prepared for the day... and <mark>pick out</mark> the right outfit. Before I leave, I <mark>put on</mark> my makeup. My classes usually start at 9.00.</p>
    <p>How many meals do you have a day?</p>
    <p>I have five or six light meals a day. I've noticed that three heavy meals a day generally <mark>weigh</mark> me <mark>down</mark>. So I try to eat less and more often. I have more energy this way and I can concentrate much better. Whenever possible, I try to <mark>squeeze in</mark> 15 to 30 minutes of exercise in the afternoon. Exercising helps me <mark>calm down</mark> when I'm stressed and it doesn't <mark>take up</mark> too much of my time.</p>
    <p>When do you usually get home?</p>
    <p>It <mark>depends on</mark> the day, but typically I get home at around 6 pm. I have dinner a litter later then I <mark>lie down</mark> for a few minutes and <mark>scroll down</mark> social media on my phone. Next, I study for a few hours. Then I watch TV. I try to <mark>stay away</mark> from negative news. I usually <mark>go for</mark> comedies. Before going to bed, I <mark>fill in</mark> my journal and <mark>reflect on</mark> the day. My journal helps me with me emotions and thoughts. It also helps me to set goals. I <mark>plan on</mark> taking a French course this year. That's my new goal. I love to learn and <mark>try out</mark> new things all the time. I just want to <mark>point out</mark> that a journal is really helpful.</p>
    <p>Yeah, I see. Maybe I should keep a journal, too. I have many goals that I would like to achieve. I want to <mark>sign for</mark> a gym membership, but I just keep <u title="trì hoãn (ngày 43)">putting it off</u>. I never actually <mark>get around to</mark> ever doing it. I <mark>plan on</mark> keeping a diet and <mark>cutting down</mark> on sweets. But I never <u title="thực hiện được (ngày 161)">make it</u>. I need something sweet every day to help me <mark>get through</mark> busy days. To <mark>sum</mark> it all <mark>up</mark>, I think I'm a mess.</p>
    <p>Just <mark>stick to</mark> your goals and don't <mark>give up</mark>. Your effort will finally <mark>pay off</mark>.</p>
    <p>What do you usually do in your free time?</p>
    <p>Sometimes I <mark>sleep in</mark> on weekends, when I'm tired. I like to <mark>go out</mark> and <mark>catch up on</mark> friends and family. What about you? You're in the third year, right? What's your day like?</p>
    <p>My schedule always <mark>runs over</mark> no matter how organized I am. I <mark>get up</mark> pretty late, about 9 am. My chaotic morning <mark>messes up</mark> the rest of the day. I wish I could <mark>wake up</mark> earlier, but sleep is <mark>holding</mark> me <mark>back</mark> each morning. I go to bed very late, at about 1 am. I haven't been able to change this yet, but I'm <mark>working on</mark> it.</p>
    <p>I'm sure you'll finally make it. I have a very busy schedule. That's why I never <mark>show up</mark> on time anywhere. The problem is that I have <u title="bắt đầu công việc (ngày 197)">taken up</u> a part-time job at the mall, so I go to work every day after classes. There's just too much <mark>going on</mark> in my life right now. I'm not great at <mark>dealing with</mark> stress.</p>
    <p>Maybe you need to <mark>slow down</mark> and <mark>cut back</mark> on some activities, otherwise you'll <mark>burn</mark> yourself <mark>out</mark>.</p>
    <p>You're perfectly right. I'll drop a few activities and <mark>set aside</mark> time for rest.</p>
    <p>Do you want to <mark>come round</mark> on Saturday night? I'm throwing a party.</p>
    <p>I'm not sure about that. You know I'<mark>m</mark> not <mark>into</mark> parties.</p>
    <p>Please don't <mark>turn</mark> me <mark>down</mark>. We'll have a great time.</p>
    <p>OK then, if it's so important to you, I'll try to come.</p>
    <p>Great! I'm looking forward to it!</p>
    <p>Do I need to <u title="ăn mặc diện (ngày 158)">dress up</u>?</p>
    <p>No, you can wear casual clothes. I have to go now. I don't want to <u title="làm mất thời gian (ngày 197)">take up</u> any more of your time. And I have to <mark>get down</mark> to studying.</p>
