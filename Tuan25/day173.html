      <p>I've been <dfn data-inf="(adj) sống">alive</dfn> for over 28 years now and <u title="mặc dù (ngày 10)">despite</u> having <u title="(adj) quan trọng (ngày 50)">significant</u> events in my life... I have some pretty random <mark>assortment of</mark> memories from my <mark>childhood</mark>.</p>
      <p>Take my 18th birthday, for example. It's supposed to represent the day I entered <mark>adulthood</mark>. But I actually don't remember what I did that day. It was a Saturday, so I wasn't at school, but I was in architecture so I was definitely doing homework. I know I didn't <u title="(v) tổ chức (ngày 68)">hold</u> a big party so I probably just had a nice dinner with my family. Except I don't even remember where we ate...</p>
      <p>So I don't <mark>recall</mark> my adulthood gateway birthday from 10 years ago. But I do remember the last night I was in Philippines. 20 years ago, before <u title="nhập cư (ngày 169)">immigrating</u> to Canada. I guess that you can <u title="(v) tranh biện (ngày 104)">debate</u> that moving away would be a pretty <u title="(adj) quan trọng (ngày 50)">significant</u> event, but when I was 6, I didn't understand how far Canada was and how life-changing this move was actually going to be.</p>
      <p>Anyway, I remember that night, not because we had a long travel ahead of us... but because I was sleeping on the floor in the living room I guess, so, once we wake up it would be easier to quickly leave the house to go to the airport. I was a little <mark>restless</mark> and was <mark>tossing around</mark> and then turned towards the couch. And that's when a <mark>cockroach</mark> <mark>crawled out</mark> and then disappeared away from my <mark>peripherals</mark>. That's it, that's my last memory before moving.</p>
      <p>In grade 2, when we first moved to Canada, I made a friend who invited me to <dfn data-inf="(ph.v) đến nhà chơi">come over</dfn> and play with his Transformer toys. I get to his house and we go to his room. And me all ready being a troll at that age, I go straight to his dresser and open one of the drawers. I find his underwear and pull one out, and yell "OOOOO UnderWear" like he's supposed to be <u title="(adj) xấu hổ, ngượng, ngại (ngày 122)">embarrassed</u> of it or something... like "ha ha ha I wear these too, but I'm gonna <u title="trêu (ngày 144)">make fun of</u> you for it!". Kids are such jerks.</p>
      <p>He laughs nervously, and then we <u title="(v) tiếp tục (ngày 80)">proceed</u> to play with his toys. And that's how I remember Marcus... a <mark>chubby</mark> kid with cool toys that wore "tighty-whities" like me.</p>
      <p>In grade 4, I was out at <mark>recess</mark> playing a big game of man hunt with a bunch of kids. Manhunt is basically just tag, but if you get caught you join the hunter team and help tag the others until everyone is caught. I was hiding out between two portables. I think Americans call them <mark>trailers</mark>? Which wasn't really a great <u title="(n) địa điểm, chỗ (để trốn, núp) (ngày 83)">spot</u> because it was a dead end. If someone found me there, my exit would be blocked. And <u title="thực tế (add information) (ngày 110)">indeed</u>, someone found me there and... blocked my exit.</p>
      <p>There was maybe 3 to 4 meters between the portables which gave me a tiny bit of room to try and <mark>juke</mark> my way past the hunter, except there was a loose nail sticking out of one of the portables which caught my shirt as i was <mark>escaping</mark> and made a huge <mark>tear</mark> right under my <mark>armpit</mark> and also gave me a big <dfn data-inf="(n) vết đứt, vết thương">cut</dfn>.</p>
      <p>But I was more embarrassed than pained. So <u title="thay vì (ngày 10)">instead of</u> going to the teacher for some help, I just... <mark>fled</mark> and continued playing the game 'cause i go hard. I play to win. And even when <mark>recess</mark> was over, I continued to try and <mark>hide</mark> my "battle <mark>wound</mark>" for the rest of the day, as if it was a sign of weakness like: "Ugh... I can't let them know I <mark>bleed</mark>..."</p>
      <p>Uhhh, Mr. Sandal, Dominic is bleeding.</p>
      <p>SHHHHHUT UPP.</p>
      <p>There was this one time in P.E., or phys. ed or gym or whatever you wanna call it, and we were playing basketball. If you've ever met me <u title="trực tiếp (ngày 154)">in person</u> and thought I'm really short, well, you're right to <mark>assume</mark> that i was the smallest kid in my class for the duration of my childhood.</p>
      <p>We were <u title="chia (ngày 149)">split up</u> into teams and mine had some <mark>bllllllloody</mark> good players! hehehe who were black. At one point we were on the opponent side and my teammate, Mark, was in a position to either <dfn data-inf="(v) chuyền (bóng)">pass</dfn> to me, or to my other taller and more skilled teammate. He passed to me. I went for a three... cash moneeey!!!!!</p>
      <p>And even though I scored, my teammate still complained like: "Hey man, why didn't you pass to me?" and Mark replied with: "What? Dom is a good shot!". Which was a LIE. I mean, I was <mark>decent</mark>, definitely not as good as the other guy, but I feel like Mark said that to just to <mark>justify</mark> his choice. And even though I probably scored like 1 more point for the rest of the game, I had such a huge <u title="(n) (bổ sung) năng lượng (ngày 48)">boost</u> of self-confidence after hearing Mark's <u title="những lời cổ vũ, động viên (ngày 36)">encouraging words</u>.</p>
      <p>In Grade 5, I had a crush on this girl in my class: Stephanie. The same Stephanie from my Crushes video. It think it was like the last day of class before summer break and we were having a relaxed day. My teacher had a piano in the classroom and allowed the students to play on it. During that time, one of my favorite songs was All My Life by K-Ci & JoJo. And the intro to that song is literally the only thing I know how to play on the piano. And so I requested to play, sat down, and played the intro to the song in hopes to <u title="(v) tạo/gây ấn tượng với (ngày 82)">impress</u> Stephanie.</p>
      <p>Afterwards, the other kids, INCLUDING Stephanie, <mark>cheered me on</mark> because, they thought it was <u title="dành cho (ngày 37)">dedicated</u> to Bridget... another girl who openly had a crush on me. And, I guess from my little performance people thought those feelings were now mutual... which they weren't... But I didnt want to embarass Bridget by trying to <u title="nói rằng họ đã hiểu sai, bài đàn tôi đánh là dành cho Stephanie chứ không phải Bridget như họ nghĩ">correct</u> <u title="đám đông (ngày 159)">the crowd</u> so... yea I-I just went with it.</p>
      <p>This last one was kind of a suppressed memory because I was so embarrased when it happened. Also, TMI (too much info) warning. Alright, so growing up, after pooping, I was taught to use, what we Filipinos call a "Tabo" - a small bucket with a handle that we fill up with water to wash our <mark>butts</mark> with. That's right, we believe toilet paper alone isn't enough.</p> 
      <p>At a young age, I was too weak to carry the "tabo" <mark>on my own</mark> with one hand because, obviously I needed the other to wash my <mark>anus</mark>. So usually when I was done delivering the <u title="shits">package</u> , I'd yell for my parents or older sister to help pour the water while I clean myself.</p>
      <p>One day, we were at a family friend's house and the parents had to <u title="= go out">head out</u> for a bit. Leaving us, the kids, at the home. <mark>Destiny</mark> <mark>determined</mark> that I had to poop exactly in the time frame they were <u title="vắng mặt (ngày 13)">absent</u> so, naturally I had to depend on my older sister to <u title="giúp tôi (ngày 145)">help me out</u> <u title="ngay sau khi (ngày 90)">once</u> I was done dropping the <u title="shits">mail</u>. EXCEPT, I had to go real bad, and didn't get a chance to warn my sister <mark>ahead of time</mark> to <u title="để ý lời gọi của tôi">keep an ear out for my call</u>. And so I'm there, on the toilet, finished with the load... I left the door slightly <mark>ajar</mark> so I could be heard and at first I called out to my sister, at a medium volume: Ate... Which, in Tagalog, means older sister or a <u title="tôn trọng (ngày 136)">respectful</u> <u title="thuật ngữ (ngày 27)">term</u> for a girl who is slightly older than you.</p>
      <p>She didn't hear me... and so, I kept calling out increasingly getting louder until I was heard. And, surely enough, I was. Except it wasn't my sister who came to greet me... it was the family friend.</p>
      <p>And when you're caught on the toilet, there's actually nothing you can do to minimize how <mark>defenseless</mark> you look. She laughed hard and, I just had to take it until she got a <mark>whiff</mark> of my <mark>aroma</mark> and then left the scene. Maximum embarrasment.</p>
      <p>AND SO FROM THAT DAY ON I <mark>MATURED</mark> INTO <mark>INDEPENDENCE</mark> NEVER AGAIN HAVING TO <mark>RELY ON</mark> ANYONE TO ASSIST ME IN CLEANING MYSELF AFTER A POOP.</p>
      <p>Because, now, I rely on technology! This is a <mark>bidet</mark>.</p>
      <p>HOLY SHI*!!</p>
