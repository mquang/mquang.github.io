      <p>Hello?</p>
      <p>Uhh... Okay. It's for you, James.</p>
      <p>Hey, James. This is James from the future. Just wanted you to give you a call and let you know that, <u title="">puberty</u> can be <mark>tough</mark>, but, you can get through it.</p>
      <p>So I wanted to let you know that everything's gonna be okay and... I love you.</p>
      <p>You got the wrong number.</p>
      <p>I grew up in a <mark>generation</mark> where smartphones where a new thing. And everyone in my class had one <u title="">except for</u> me. My parents never got me one because they didn't want me to <u title="">access</u> the Internet on a device that could fit in my pocket because they were super strict and didn't want me looking at... internet stuff... which <mark>backfired</mark> horribly.</p>
      <p>So, they never gave me a smartphone. In fact, I didn't even get my first cellphone until I was 16 years old. Now as an adult who uses his cellphone everyday, I don't know how I survived for 16 years without one.</p>
      <p>I think when I was younger If I was ever in a situation where I needed to call my parents I would just ask the nearest person if I could borrow their phone.</p>
      <p>Now if there's are any parents watching this who haven't given their children a cellphone yet, take it from a guy on the internet with no children, you should get them one.</p>
      <p>It doesn't have to be a smart one. You can just give them your standard drug dealer phone. But you should at least give them a cellphone in case there's an emergency and they need to call you or the police.</p>
      <p>The only <mark>downside</mark> I can think of giving your child a phone is: They'll end up spending TOO much time on it. So.. you should just turn off their service from time to time I don't know.</p>
      <p>When I turned 16 and finished up my <mark>sophomore</mark> year of high school, I got my very first cellphone: An LG Cosmos 2. I didn't grow up in the 90s... Tha- everyone else had iphones. But I was the only one with a fli- with a phone that had a keyboard on it.</p>
      <p>And with that cellphone, I've had a couple of <mark>incidents</mark> where sometimes a random person would call me thinking I was someone else... And then wouldn't admit they're wrong.</p>
      <p>And that's how you <mark>segue</mark> into the theme of this month's video.</p>
      <p>This first story happened when I was working at Sooubway. THATS RIGHT ANOTHER SOOUBWAY STORY</p>
      <p>#SOOUBWAY 4. It wasn't good enough to be in the other 3.</p> 
      <p>So it was 5 minutes until closing and we get a phone call on the Sooubway phone. I pick it up and say, "UGHHHHH..Thank for calling Sooubway. How may I help you?" I was supposed to say, "This is James . How may I help you?" But I wasn't about to tell this random stranger my name... Idiot.</p>
      <p>Anyway, the other person on the line said, "Hey what time do you guys close?"</p>
      <p>"in five minutes"</p>
      <p>"Is it alright if I show up late? I just need gas."</p>
      <p>And being the good employee that I was, I was totally willing to make this guy's sandwich over the phone, let him pick it up after we closed, and then I wouldn't ring him up and just <mark>pocket</mark> the money. I'm just kidding I wouldn't do that. That's a <mark>crime</mark>. Please don't <mark>sue</mark> me.</p>
      <p>So I said, "Yeah I can do that. What kind of sandwich do you want?"</p>
      <p>And he said, "I just need gas."</p>
      <p>"Oh don't worry, sir. This sandwich will give you plenty of gas. I... I mean, do you want chips or something?"</p>
      <p>"No." he said. "I just need gas."</p>
      <p>I was a little confused. "Okay, yes. So, you'll get gas, then are you gonna stop by and pick up a sandwich?"</p>
      <p>And he said, "I don't want a sandwich." And then it hit me. Even though the first thing I ever said to this guy was: "Thank you for calling Sooubway," I think he thought he was talking to a gas station. So I said, "Sir, this is a Sooubway."</p>
      <p>"OHHHHHHHHHHHHHH."</p>
      <p>And I never got the chance to tell him that <mark>gas pumps</mark> don't close.</p>
      <p>This next story happened when I was at home and I got a call from a number I didn't recognize. Now, I've had friends tell me that they don't answer the phone to any number they don't recognize. But my <u title="ngày 97">anxiety</u> won't let me do that. What if it's your bank calling saying your account got hacked? What if it's your grandma 'cause why would you have her saved in your phone? Or what if it's your Nigerian uncle who wants to give you his collection of gold bars and needs your information for a <u title="ngày 58">wire transfer</u>?</p>
      <p>You just never know, so I always pick up the phone. So, I answered it and it was this woman asking for a Lawrence. and I said, "Oh I'm not- that- that's- You have the wrong number."</p>
      <p>And she goes "isn't this 416 295?"</p>
      <p>That's obviously not a real number, so don't try calling it.</p>
      <p>And I said, "No, this is four one six two nine three." 'Cause, that's my phone number. Again, that's not actually a <mark>valid</mark> phone number. So, please don't call it.</p>
      <p>And she goes, "Three? I don't think I pressed three."</p>
      <p>And, I don't know what to say to this woman. Because my number is four one six two nine three (it's really not) but she doesn't think she pushed three so I don't know how she's talking to me right now unless she did so I said "well obviously... you did."</p>
      <p>And then I made a <mark>comic</mark> about the whole situation because I thought the internet would think it was funny.</p>
      <p>This next story happened not too long ago I got a call from a number I didn't recognize at 9:30 in the morning and I was lying in my bed asleep and most people would agree that you're supposed to be awake and productive at 9:30 and I didn't want whoever this stranger was thinking I'm lazy so I had to answer the phone with my best I've-been-awake-for-several-hours voice</p>
      <p>HUU HOO HUU HOO HUU HOO HUU</p>
      <p>Hello?</p>
      <p>You’re going to have to come quickly. Timmy fell down the <mark>well</mark>, Vance.</p>
      <p>Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh Wuuuuuuuuuuut?</p>
      <p>I said you’re gonna have to come quickly cuz Timmy fell down the well, Vance.</p>
      <p>I could tell it was a woman on the phone but it was either her accent or the phone being buggy or I just had woken up but I could not understand anything she was saying but I could make out one word which was Vance so I did not have a lot to go off of I said "I... think you have the wrong number"</p>
      <p>okay... goodbye</p>
      <p>Well I should probably get the day started I thought as I went back to sleep but then immediately I got a call from the same number and I thought okay maybe if this person is calling again even after I <mark>explicitly</mark> told her she had the wrong number, maybe it's not a wrong number after all, maybe there's something else going on, maybe it's an emergency so maybe mmm talk to me</p>
      <p>HO-LE LO-LE HASJKDALSFHLK VANCE</p>
      <p>Okay I can't understand anything you're saying so then this woman must have handed the phone to her friend because a different voice started talking and I could actually understand her and I'll never forget what she said which was: "Vance no one thinks that you're funny" and even though I'm not Vance that kind of hurt so I stated the obvious which was: "Yes I am and also I'm not Vance", and she said "No, Lance" so this whole time these two have been looking for "a Lance" so I told this woman, "I'm not Lance either" and she said, "WELL THIS IS THE NUMBER THEY GAVE ME"</p>
      <p>Okay if she had said it like, "Oh I'm sorry this is the number they gave me I didn't mean to all you stranger. Also I do think you're funny and enjoy your videos." then that would have been totally fine. She's just <mark>shifting</mark> the <u title="ngày 181">blame</u> to someone else but instead she sounded so <mark>condescending</mark> like I was wasting her time, "Well this is the number they gave me and they can't be wrong so you must be the real Lance!"</p>
      <p>So I said, "Well they must have given it to you wrong!"</p>
      <p>Look, I'm too tired to be polite. But then she hung up on me like this woman just basically called a random person said, "You're not funny" and then hung up so I decided to call her back and said, "Hey I just found the real Lance, he's the funniest guy I ever met and he told me he doesn't give his phone number out to RUDE PIECES OF SHI-!"</p>
      <p>Just kidding on the last part, I thought about doing it but then I went back to sleep. I didn't do it. And then someone on the internet found my phone number and I changed it. And whoever has my old number is probably getting a lot of calls from strangers and people I went to high school with, sorry about that.</p>
