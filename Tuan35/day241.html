      <p>Hi guys. Welcome back to “On the go with EF”. Today I am still in Vancouver, but I have a special guest.  Look who’s here!</p>

      <p>Hi guys!</p>

      <p>Right now, we are on the free <mark>shuttle bus</mark> going to the Capilano <u title="">Suspension Bridge</u> Park. It’s going to be a lot of fun.</p>

      <p>We’re going to do something very <mark>thrilling</mark> and quite high up.</p>

      <p>Right now, we are about 9 km away from Vancouver. This is one of the great things about Vancouver. It’s so close to nature, which is also why I appreciate the city so much.</p>

      <p>Yeah, it’s pretty cool. I picked up this map on the way in and it has all the different attractions that there are here. There’s a tree house, a boardwalk, the suspension bridge, and the Cliffwalk. Do you think we should try some of these attractions?</p>

      <p>Yeah, let’s go.</p>

      <p>I’m getting kind of <mark>antsy</mark>. I’m really excited about this bridge, so I think we should go.</p>

      <p>I think I see the bridge.</p>

      <p>It’s there! Look at it.</p>

      <p>I think I see a river, too.</p>

      <p>Yeah, there’s a river there.</p>

      <p>It’s super high.</p>

      <p>It’s so long, though. Are you afraid of heights?</p>

      <p>A little, but I think I’ll be okay. What about you?</p>

      <p>Yeah, I think we’ll be fine. We should go do it then.</p>

      <p>Okay. Let’s go.</p>

      <p>I’m getting a little nervous right now. I’m not going to lie. Are you nervous now?</p>

      <p>No, I’m okay. I’m still okay.</p>

      <p>Good.</p>

      <p>No running, jumping or intentionally shaking the bridge. We won’t be doing that, for sure.

      <p>Alright. Let’s go.</p>

      <p>We’ll be fine. Oh wow. I’m going to just hold onto the railing here. Just because it’s a little <mark>wobbly</mark>, you want to make sure you don’t fall. What do you think, Asia? Are you okay?</p>

      <p>I think my heart just dropped a little.</p>

      <p>I want to pull out my phone to take some pictures, but I’m really scared I’m going to drop my phone.</p>

      <p>Oh, yeah. Do you think we’ll see some bears?</p>

      <p>Possibly.</p>

      <p>Do you have bears here?</p>

      <p>Yeah, it’s quite common here.</p>

      <p>You shouldn’t have told me that.</p>

      <p>There are mostly black bears or <mark>grizzly bears</mark>.</p>

      <p>To be fair, we are in their <mark>territory</mark>. We’re actually <mark>invading</mark> their space.</p>

      <p>This is their home.</p>

      <p>Yeah, and it’s beautiful.</p>

      <p>This bridge was created in 1889, and it’s 130 years old right now. That’s older than my grandma.</p>

      <p>The bridge is 137 metres long and 70 metres high. My heart is definitely beating a little faster right now. I wouldn’t say that I’m scared, but it’s just a very thrilling experience. I wonder what that is. Do you think we could do that?</p>

      <p>Yeah, that’s the cliff walk.</p>

      <p>I am so excited to do the cliff walk. I’m really curious to know how they actually built this bridge. How did they attach it on one side and get it to the other side. And this was in the 1890s, too.</p>

      <p>1889. Yeah.</p>

      <p>I mean, how did they do it? This was so much fun. Did you love it?</p>

      <p>Yeah, I liked it.</p>

      <p>I really loved it, but it’s time to get off.</p>

      <p>It was a little scary, but it was okay.</p>

      <p>I’m still a little bit wobbly after that bridge. This is cool. What is this?</p>

      <p>It’s the Nature’s Edge Boardwalk. Look how pretty this is! There are more trees with more lights.</p>

      <p>Look at all the lights down there.</p>

      <p>This would be so pretty during nighttime.</p>

      <p>But would you want to walk here at nighttime?</p>

      <p>I think it would be romantic.</p>

      <p>Yeah, I guess it would be.</p>

      <p>This is such a nice place to get away from the city.</p>

      <p>It is.</p>

      <p>A breath of fresh air.</p>

      <p>The air just feels so clean here. You just want to breath it all in.</p>

      <p>And this is actually a temperate rainforest.</p>

      <p>Really?</p>

      <p>Yeah, a lot of people think of rainforests and imagine the Amazon, but this is a rainforest as well. It’s just a different type. We have a lot of exotic plants and a lot of trees.</p>

      <p>That’s so cool. I had no idea.</p>

      <p>Guys, I’m a magician. Watch this.</p>

      <p>Ooh. Let’s do it together. One, two, three.</p>

      <p>This is so cool!</p> 

      <p>Lights! Lights!</p>

      <p>I want to have these at my house. That would be cool.</p>

      <p>Let’s hug this tree.</p>

      <p>Yeah. Take a moment.</p>

      <p>Be one with nature.</p>

      <p>It’s really relaxing to be here and just be present, and take it all in.</p>

      <p>Be good to your nature, guys.</p>

      <p>Bye, tree!</p>

      <p>Bye, tree! Thanks for the hug.</p>

      <p>Oh my gosh. This is so pretty.</p>

      <p>It’s gorgeous. It’s almost like a little fairy tale forest.</p>

      <p>Wow.</p> 

      <p>It’s beautiful with all the lights. You have the water running. It sounds very calming and <mark>soothing</mark>.</p>

      <p>I love the lights.</p>

      <p>It’s a nice feeling.</p>

      <p>This is such a nice walk.</p>

      <p>It’s gorgeous. There’s a little lake here.</p>

      <p>Yeah.</p>

      <p>Feel the tree’s energy.</p>

      <p>Oh yeah, close your eyes. Take a moment.</p>

      <p>Power.</p>

      <p>Let’s get some energy from the tree. Do you feel energized? I kind of do.</p> 

      <p>Yeah.</p> 

      <p>Come on.</p>

      <p>We need a picture here. Okay. Are you ready? One, two, three. That’s cute.</p>

      <p>I feel a little hungry.</p>

      <p>Yeah, I feel like we should get something to eat. They have poutine on the menu.</p>

      <p>Do you want to get it?</p>

      <p>Yeah.</p>

      <p>Thank you so much. Look at this!  I can’t wait to sit down and eat this.</p>

      <p>If you’re in Canada, you have to try poutine. It’s a must.</p>

      <p>Basically, poutine is a very traditional Canadian dish, I would say. It’s French fries, <mark>cheese curds</mark> and <mark>gravy</mark>. And that’s it.</p>

      <p>Sometimes some companies like to add a little bit more like bacon or chives, or something extra. But this is the original poutine and it is very tasty.</p>

      <p>Well, this was a nice snack!</p>

      <p>Yeah, it’s so good.</p>

      <p>I feel like we’ve got some more energy now after having a snack, so should we go and explore some more?</p>

      <p>Yeah.</p>

      <p>Let’s get it to go.</p>

      <p>Okay.</p>

      <p>We are here at the Cliffwalk and we thought we’d go check it out and see what it’s like.</p>

      <p>Let’s go.</p>

      <p>Yes. Here we go.</p>

      <p>Alright. It’s nice. You get to walk along the cliff.</p>

      <p>It is nice.</p>

      <p>Wow. I can see the bottom.</p>

      <p>Yeah, it’s actually really high up.</p>

      <p>Yeah, it is.</p>

      <p>You can see the bridge, and there’s the water down here. This side is open and on this side you have the cliff.</p>

      <p>I feel like a mountain goat, just walking along the cliff wall.</p>

      <p>And climbing the mountain?</p>

      <p>Yeah.</p>

      <p>Oh, this part is really cool, how it goes out.</p>

      <p>Yeah. We’re almost the same height as the trees. That’s crazy.</p>

      <p>It’s so crazy. I’m really enjoying this. This is a good idea.</p>

      <p>I love how the park includes so many activities, not just the bridge. It’s a really good place to visit.</p>

      <p>Okay, this spot is amazing.</p>

      <p>Oh my goodness. You can see the bottom. This is such a nice spot!</p>

      <p>Wow. This is so cool.</p>

      <p>I think we need a picture here.</p>

      <p>Yeah, definitely.</p>

      <p>Let’s take a selfie.</p>

      <p>Okay.</p>

      <p>So, guys, we’ve had an amazing time here at the Capilano Suspension Bridge Park. It was super fun and thrilling to walk across the bridge, and there are so many other fun activities that you can do here at the park. So, if you’re ever in Vancouver, we can highly recommend that you come and explore it yourself.</p>

      <p>So, comment down below whether or not you are afraid of heights and you’ll get this wonderful chance of winning this awesome water bottle.</p>

      <p>It’s so nice, right? In two weeks we’re going to be up with a new episode. Asia and I are going to explore a little bit more of Vancouver. I’m super excited to see more of the city, so please don’t miss that. We’ll see you then. Bye!</p>
