      <p>Hi guys! Today is our last day here in Vancouver and we are going to be showing  you guys Granville Island. There’s a really interesting public market there. But first we’re going to Stanley Park where I’m going to show you something cool.

      <p>Oooh, I’m excited.</p>

      <p>Yeah.</p>

      <p>Can we walk there?</p>

      <p>Definitely. It’s just nearby.</p>

      <p>Okay, cool. Let’s walk.</p>

      <p>So, all the buildings around here are very different. Like this one, it’s completely glass <mark>whereas</mark> the one over there has a little bit more of a Victorian feeling.</p>

      <p>And what about this one? It’s <mark>slanted</mark>.</p>

      <p>Yeah, it is. It’s very cool.</p>

      <p>And this one is super tall.</p>

      <p>Yeah.</p>

      <p>Imagine living all the way up there. That view must be extra special. Yeah, definitely.</p>

      <p>Alright. Let’s go.</p>

      <p>I really like the <u title="ngày 157">vibe</u> of Vancouver. I love that it’s a big city and you’ve got the <u title="ngày 167">skyscrapers</u> and that whole feeling, but at the same time, it’s pretty relaxed. I don’t feel <u title="ngày 209">rushed</u>. I’m just enjoying this walk.</p>

      <p>Here we are in Stanley Park. There’s a lot to do here. There are some beautiful <u title="ngày 155">trails</u> and this beautiful <mark>seawall</mark> as well. You know what? I’m going to show you something really cool.</p>

      <p>Oh, wow! Is that a <mark>totem pole</mark>?</p>

      <p>Yeah, exactly. There are actually nine of them there.</p>

      <p>That is pretty amazing. This totem pole is really tall, isn’t it?</p>

      <p>It definitely is. And each <u title="ngày 189">carving</u> represents a true or <mark>mythical</mark> event that happened. They served as a kind of decorative piece. They’re very <mark>spiritual</mark>, but not <u title="ngày 233">worshipped</u>.</p>

      <p>Right. I love the different characters that you can see on the totem poles.</p>

      <p>Yeah, and there’s the bottom person who’s very happy.</p>

      <p>Very happy and very welcoming.</p>

      <p>The totem poles <u title="ngày 189">are carved</u> from cedar and they are just one pole.</p>

      <p>Really?</p>

      <p>They are not <u title="ngày 70">separate</u> pieces of wood <u title="ngày 104">stuck</u> together; they are just one pole.</p>

      <p>That is impressive. I just think it’s so incredible that we’re able to be outdoors and see these totem poles. It just makes it a more <u title="ngày 73">authentic</u> experience rather than having to go to a museum and look at them, right?</p>

      <p>It’s so true. They’re close to the nature, right where they belong.</p>

      <p>Yeah.</p>

      <p>Here we are at Granville Island! This place used to be a <mark>wasteland</mark>, but now there are a lot of art stores, cool restaurants, and a really nice public market. Do you want to check it out?</p>

      <p>Sounds fun. I want to see that.</p>

      <p>Look at this. Flower <mark>crowns</mark>.</p> 

      <p>That almost looks like a flower cake.</p>

      <p>I was going to say that.</p>

      <p>Right? These are gorgeous, too. Is this not a traditional Mexican <u title="ngày 174">skull</u>? Very cool.</p>

      <p>I love coming here and one thing I love the most is the bakeries.</p> 

      <p>They have bakeries?</p>

      <p>Yeah. They have so many <u title="ngày 72">varieties</u> of baked goods that I can never <u title="ngày 218">resist</u>.</p>

      <p>The only thing I’m seeing right now are these baked goods over here. Oh my goodness.</p>

      <p>Wow.</p> 

      <p>They have all these <mark>tarts</mark>. Like this one. A mini pumpkin pie! That’s really cute.</p>

      <p>My sweet tooth is <mark>aching</mark> already.</p>

      <p>I know. So many <mark>goodies</mark>!</p>

      <p>I don’t know which one to pick.</p>

      <p>Me neither. We need a little bit of time to decide.</p>

      <p>Yeah.</p> 

      <p>Let’s see what else they have. They have free masala chai tea. Should we try it?</p>

      <p>Yeah. Let’s try it. Oh, it’s creamy.</p>

      <p>It’s nice and warm.</p>

      <p>It’s really warm.</p>

      <p>It tastes like a chai latte. It’s a really nice taste, actually. It’s perfect because it’s a little <u title="ngày 121">chilly</u> today, so this is nice to warm yourself up a bit.</p>

      <p>Yeah, it’s perfect for this weather.</p>

      <p>I think this is just one part of the market. There’s a lot more to see.</p>

      <p>Really? We need to go to the other side and check out what they have over there.</p>

      <p>Yeah, let’s check it out.</p>

      <p>They have so many different food places here. It’s like a food court. They have a nice little salad bar over here. You can get some fresh salad.</p>

      <p>You can get coffee.</p>

      <p>Oh, vegan brownies.</p>

      <p>It’s nice to see that they have some <u title="ngày 89">vegan</u> options here as well.</p>

      <p>Some variety, yeah.</p>

      <p>Oh, <mark>clay</mark> art. This is jewelry. Oh my gosh, it’s so cute.</p>

      <p>That’s really cute.</p>

      <p><mark>Ladybug</mark> for good luck.</p>

      <p>Isn’t true that when a ladybug lands on you, it means good luck?</p>

      <p>Yeah.</p>

      <p>I think so.</p>

      <p>Wait. How cute is this? These are kids’ hats.</p> 

      <p>A little pumpkin hat.</p>

      <p>Look at this one with all the little flowers on it. It’s so adorable.</p>

      <p>How cute is this little bunny? There’s a panda. It’s so cute.</p>

      <p>The Canadian flag. This is actually really nice.</p>

      <p>There is so much stuff here.</p> 

      <p>I had no idea. There is a big variety of things. You can get anything here, right?</p>

      <p>Yeah. There’s actually a really famous donut place here. It’s called Lee’s Donuts. We should go check that out. Definitely.</p>

      <p>Yeah, let’s go.</p>

      <p>There’s already a line forming.</p>

      <p>What kind of flavours do you like?</p>

      <p>Sometimes I like old-fashioned donuts. Sometimes I like glazed.</p>

      <p>Mmm. Glazed donuts are good.</p>

      <p>Honeycomb.</p>

      <p>I really like anything with chocolate.</p>

      <p>Chocolate <u title="ngày 63">dipped</u>?</p>

      <p>Yeah, that is probably my favourite kind of donut.</p>

      <p>When they have too many different <u title="ngày 138">flavours</u>, it’s too hard to decide.</p>

      <p>Yeah.</p>

      <p>I’m excited. Donut dance.</p>

      <p>Thank you!</p>

      <p>That looks like a good spot.</p>

      <p>Wow. This is the perfect spot.</p>

      <p>This is amazing. What a fun market that was. I really enjoyed myself. Did you?</p>

      <p>Yeah. I totally did.</p>

      <p>Okay, do you want to try them at the same time?</p>

      <p>Okay. Let’s try it.</p>

      <p>It’s so good.</p>

      <p>It’s amazing.</p>

      <p>It was so worth <mark>lining up</mark> for these donuts. It’s very <u title="ngày 110">crispy</u> and the filling is very creamy. It’s super fresh, guys.  You need to try it. I could just <mark>devour</mark> this whole thing. Eating donuts with a beautiful view. That’s the life.</p>

      <p>I can’t believe today is your last day here.</p> 

      <p>I know.</p>

      <p>I wish you could stay longer here.</p>

      <p>I do, too, and have some more of those delicious donuts. But before we go, we want to ask you a question. Do you prefer <u title="ngày 165">sweet or salty treats</u>? Please comment below because the best answer will win two gifts. We have this maple syrup right here and a totem pole.</p> 

      <p>Don’t forget to watch the next episode. Have a great week, you guys. Bye!</p>
