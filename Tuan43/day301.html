      <p>Vanessa: All right. We found this house that we really liked and we got the A-OK that we are the ones who are going to get it, which is <u title="">excellent</u>, because there were a couple <mark>bids</mark> on the house.</p>

      <p>Dan: We <u title="to become involved in a bad situation (ngày 268)">got into</u> a <mark>bidding</mark> war.</p>

      <p>Vanessa: Yeah. This doesn't happen all the time, but it means that five people, including us, wanted to buy this house. Only one family can win. Our realtor helped us a lot to either offer the right amount of money or also, we wrote cards to the sellers. We sent them pictures. We did everything.</p>

      <p>Dan: We were a little unusual. I don't think that's very <u title="(adj) thường hay xảy ra (ngày 160)">typical</u>.</p>

      <p>Vanessa: Well, we won, so it helped.</p>

      <p>Dan: It did.</p>

      <p>Vanessa: But we did a lot of work to try to get this house because a lot of other people also wanted it. Once that was settled, we had to <u title="đóng gói, gói ghém đồ đạc (ngày 137)">pack</u> and go through that process of moving all our stuff from our apartment into this house. What was the first thing we had to do when we decided to <u title="">pack up</u> our stuff?</p>

      <p>Dan: To get ready. Well, you have to <u title="(v) mua (ngày 76)">purchase</u> boxes or we actually asked <u title="siêu thị (ngày 95)">grocery stores</u> to give us some extra boxes. Then a few weeks ahead of time, before the movers come, then you want to start really packing your stuff. Breaking down your house.</p>

      <p>Vanessa: Yeah.</p>

      <p>Dan: We started I guess with toys and books and stuff.</p>

      <p>Vanessa: Yeah. Stuff that just wasn't <u title="(adj) cần thiết, thiết yếu (ngày 95)">essential</u> for day-to-day life. We tried to pack up all that stuff. I feel like before we even did any of that, we went through all of our closets and got rid of stuff that we didn't want because-</p>

      <p>Dan: Yeah. The first step is <u title="bỏ (ngày 116)">getting rid of</u> stuff.</p>

      <p>Vanessa: Yeah. We didn't want to pack up our stuff and then unpack it at our new house and say, "We don't actually want this or need this." We wanted to only pack the essential stuff, which took a lot of time and effort, but it's worth it. It's always nice to get rid of stuff. That's how I feel. We decided to pack up our stuff. I went to some grocery stores. I went to some ABC Stores. That's <mark>liquor</mark>, alcohol stores.</p>

      <p>Dan: Yeah. The state has to sell you alcohol, at least in North Carolina. It's different in other states.</p>

      <p>Vanessa: The boxes for vodka are really <mark>heavy-duty</mark> and it's good for ... Because they're glass bottles. So it's good for packing. They're not too big, so you can put lots of books in them or heavy stuff and it's not too heavy.</p>

      <p>Dan: Yeah. People were really confused as we carried boxes of vodka around.</p>

      <p>Vanessa: Yeah.</p>

      <p>Dan: There wasn't really vodka in it.</p>

      <p>Vanessa: It was just our stuff. It's pretty common in the U.S. If you don't want to buy boxes, you can just go to grocery stores and say, "Can I have your extra boxes?" or go to a liquor store and ask for their extra boxes. It's totally normal. We got boxes. We got rid of our stuff. We packed it up about a week before we moved. You mentioned movers.</p>

      <p>Dan: Yeah. You could move everything by yourself. You could rent a truck. My dad likes to do this. He likes to do everything by himself. He's a DIY kind of person. Do-It-Yourself. He <u title="">rented</u> a truck and carried everything in the house. We didn't want to deal with that, so we <u title="(v-ed) đã thuê, mướn (ngày 25)">hired</u> some movers.</p>

      <p>Vanessa: Yeah.</p>

      <p>Dan: The company was called Two Men and a Truck.</p>

      <p>Vanessa: Yeah. There was two men and a truck. They carried our <u title="(ns) ghế sofa (ngày 266)">couches</u>, our heavy bookshelves, our kitchen tables-</p>

      <p>Dan: They had trouble parking.</p>

      <p>Vanessa: Yeah. Let's talk about that.</p>

      <p>Dan: They had to walk a really long ways because we live kind of in a <mark>downtown area</mark>, or at least we <u title="đã từng (ngày 10)">used to</u>. There was not very much parking. They brought too big of a truck. They got there and they were like, "Hey, we can't park this anywhere." So they had to park really far away and carry all our stuff.</p>

      <p>Vanessa: Yeah. They said it was the furthest they've ever had to walk for a moving experience.</p>

      <p>Dan: Yeah. It wasn't very pleasant for them.</p>

      <p>Vanessa: We lived on the second floor, so they had to go down the second floor stairs, then down the apartment stairs and then pretty much halfway down the street to even put our couch in the moving truck. It was kind of a <u title="(n) thảm họa (ngày 112)">disaster</u>. I'm <u title="(adj) vui mừng (ngày 89)">glad</u> we didn't have to do that, and because I was <u title="mới có bầu (ngày 141)">newly pregnant</u> and we have Theo, who's our two-year-old. We didn't want to carry our couches by ourselves. I personally think it is very worth the price.</p>

      <p>Dan: Yeah, especially looking at the guys who carried our couch and stuff. They were really big.</p>

      <p>Vanessa: They're the professionals.</p>

      <p>Dan: You can tell from me, I'm not going to be able to carry these things.</p>

      <p>Vanessa: Yeah. They had some funny <mark>banter</mark>, when I was listening to them talk. They were joking like, "Oh, I can carry this couch all by myself. Can you do it? Oh, I can carry this bookshelf by myself." They were just playing together.</p>

      <p>Dan: Competition was steep.</p>

      <p>Vanessa: Yep. It's just a funny thing to watch. The day that we moved, the movers came and we'd already signed the papers for the house. The house was ours. The movers came and very importantly, Dan's mom came to watch Theo, our two-year-old. It was amazing. We didn't have to also take care of him while we were helping the movers.</p>

      <p>Dan: Yeah. A <u title="đứa trẻ chập chững biết đi (ngày 183)">toddler</u> is not a big help [No] during your move.</p>

      <p>Vanessa: I think he felt really confused because we'd been talking about the new house. He's visited the new house, but he was really confused about why we were packing up his toys. Finally, when we got to the new house and we unpacked his toys, just the look on his face was so funny because he kept saying, "My animals, my LEGOs-"</p>

      <p>Dan: My truck.</p>

      <p>Vanessa: Yeah. Maybe he thought he was never going to see his toys again. I'm not sure what was actually going on in his mind because we talked about it a lot, but he was surprised that he saw his toys again. It was a fun experience.</p>
