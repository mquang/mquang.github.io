      <p>Vanessa: Hi. I'm Vanessa from SpeakEnglishWithVanessa.com.</p>

      <p>Dan: I'm “Dan the Man.”</p>

      <p>Vanessa: I'm here with my husband, Dan, in our backyard. We're here today to have just a natural, <u title="(adj) informal, relaxed (ngày 157)">casual</u> conversation about big life changes. What are some big life changes that have happened recently for us?</p>

      <p>Dan: Well, in our lives, we just bought a new house.</p>

      <p>Vanessa: Our first house ever.</p>

      <p>Dan: Yes. Moved in recently. That's a very big change in your life.</p>

      <p>Vanessa: Yep, and we're having a new baby. Yay! We're going to be talking about all of these things. What it's like to rent in the U.S., <u title="gói ghém (đồ đạc) (ngày 137)">packing up</u>, moving, hiring <mark>movers</mark>, moving into a new house, what it's like to find a house or buy a house and what it's like to do all of those things while growing a new human.</p>

      <p>Dan: Oh, boy.</p>

      <p>Vanessa: Before we bought this house, where were we living?</p>

      <p>Dan: We <u title="(v-ed) đi thuê (nhà) (ngày 25)">rented</u> before we bought a house.</p>

      <p>Vanessa: Yeah. What was that <u title="quá trình đi thuê (ngày 71)">rental process</u> like? Because for a lot of people, if you own a house, you have to also sell the house before you can buy a house, but we didn't own a house first. We were just renting. What was that like?</p>

      <p>Dan: Yeah. I don't know what it's like in your country, but in America, most people rent before they buy. The first thing you usually do is you <u title="(ph.v) điền (ngày 74)">fill out</u> a rental application. You're searching online for different <u title="(ns) nhà/đất (ngày 83)">properties</u>. I'm sure some places don't have a rental application, but that probably means that they're a little bit <mark>sketchy</mark>.</p>

      <p>Vanessa: <mark>Shady</mark>.</p>

      <p>Dan: Shady, dirty.</p>

      <p>Vanessa: Yeah. The more official it is, the better, because that means they're probably actually going to <u title="(v) bảo trì (ngày 23)">maintain</u> your apartment or going to have good communication with the people who live in their rental properties. So Yeah. You probably would expect to fill out some kind of rental application. That's what we did.</p>

      <p>Dan: Right. Then you'll sign a <u title="(n) hợp đồng cho thuê (ngày 25)">lease</u>. This is how long you're going to rent a property. Usually it's a 12-month, so it's for a year. Sometimes it's six months. In our particular situation, it started out for a year.</p>

      <p>Vanessa: Yeah. We had a yearly lease first.</p>

      <p>Dan: Then it was month to month, meaning that we just paid month by month and we could leave whenever we wanted, <u title="miễn là (ngày 4)">as long as</u> we gave them I think <u title="báo trước 1 tháng (ngày 78)">one month's notice</u>.</p>

      <p>Vanessa: Sure, sure. That was really convenient for us. We knew we wanted to stay in that apartment for at least a year, but after the first year, we could leave whenever we wanted. I think it was good for us because we could be flexible, but also there was some <u title="(n) điều không thể đoán trước được (ngày 5)">unpredictability</u> with this because the owner of the property could also <u title="(v) tăng (ngày 49)">raise</u> our <u title="(n) tiền thuê (nhà) (ngày 25)">rent</u> any month. There was no yearly contract at that point, so he could raise our rent, he could tell us to leave within 30 days. It was a little bit <u title="(adj) không ổn định (ngày 261)">unstable</u>.</p>

      <p>Dan: Yeah. Usually, renting is a little more unpredictable. You never know if the price is going to go up or you'll get <mark>kicked out</mark> for some reason, but on the other hand, the <u title="(n) chủ nhà (ngày 98)">landlord</u> did pay for certain maintenance activities, like when our fan broke or when some water got behind our wall in the bathroom. Now that we own a house, we have to fix that stuff all by ourselves.</p>

      <p>Vanessa: Yep. We have to pay for it now. We had rented at that same apartment for about four and a half years. When we decided, "Okay, we want to buy a house," what was that buying process like?</p>

      <p>Dan: What was the buying process like?</p>

      <p>Vanessa: Yeah. When we decided, "Okay, I think we want to buy," what happened next?</p>

      <p>Dan: The first thing you have to do is make sure you have enough money because it takes a lot of <mark>money upfront</mark> to buy a house. You have to be able to <mark>put down</mark> what they call a <u title="(n) khoản tiền đặt cọc (ngày 288)">down payment</u>. For a long time, we <u title="không đủ tài chính để chi trả (ngày 7)">couldn't afford</u> a down payment.</p>

      <p>Vanessa: Yeah. A down payment is usually 20% of the price of the house, which is a lot of money. If you buy a house in the U.S., it's usually $150,000 up to anything. Half a million dollars, if you have a lot of money. Even 20% of $200,000, that's $40,000 that you have to have in cash to <u title="(ph.v) nộp (ngày 134)">hand over</u>, plus there's some other <u title="(ns) các chi phí (ngày 7)">expenses</u>, like when you buy a house, there's other expenses that you have to pay for. You need <u title="(phrase) 1 khoản (tiền) lớn (ngày 169)">a big chunk of</u> money when you're thinking, "Okay. Am I ready to buy a house?"</p>

      <p>Dan: It's a long process and it's gotten more difficult in the U.S. because <mark>all the prices</mark>, especially in places younger people want to live, <mark>have gone way up</mark> compared to when our parents were younger. We bought our first house way later than our parents did. It was much more affordable <mark>back in the day</mark>, back in our parents' day. I'm sure there's a lot of <mark>factors</mark> to that, but it's a little bit <u title="(adj) chán nản, tuyệt vọng (ngày 226)">depressing</u> sometimes.</p>

      <p>Vanessa: Yeah. It's really hard for younger people <mark>nowadays</mark> in the U.S. to be able to afford a house because it has changed a lot. When we thought, "Okay. We wanted to buy a house in the U.S.," you pretty much ... 98% of the time, you need to have a <mark>realtor</mark>. What did our realtor do for us?</p>

      <p>Dan: The realtor just steps you through the process. They do a lot of the <mark>legwork</mark>. We call it legwork. I remember thinking, "You know, we could probably buy a house ourselves-"</p>

      <p>Vanessa: Without a realtor. We don't need help.</p>

      <p>Dan: Yeah. I'm sure you could, but the realtor probably called, maybe 10 phone calls every single day, just for us. Just talking to people about when to set up these meetings, when to get somebody to <u title="(v) kiểm tra (ngày 26)">inspect</u> your house, where ... What's the timing for the contract? There's all kinds of little details that they work through, and they get a really big <mark>cut</mark>. A slice of the price that you pay. That's how they get paid, by <u title="(n) tiền hoa hồng (ngày 34)">commission</u>.</p>

      <p>Vanessa: They get paid by commission, <u title="tùy thuộc (ngày 173)">depending on</u> the price of the house that you buy. For us, I don't know if it's the same for other states, but in North Carolina where we live, the realtor ... We paid her nothing. We never paid her anything, but the seller of this house, the previous owners, they paid six percent. They paid three percent to our realtor and they paid three percent to their own realtor. So they have to <mark>foot the bill</mark> for that, which means they had to pay for it. As the buyer, pretty <u title="(n) món hời (ngày 110)">good deal</u> for us. We don't have to pay at all, but someday when we sell this house, we'll have to pay for our realtor and their realtor. She was so helpful. Yeah. Maybe if this was our fifth house that we bought, maybe we could do some of that ourselves, but it's the first time we've ever done this. We have no idea what we're doing. It was really helpful because she was an amazing person.</p>

      <p>Dan: Very helpful.</p>
