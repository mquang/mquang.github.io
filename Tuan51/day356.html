      <p>Hi. I’m Molly. Something <u title="tệ, kinh khủng (ngày 298)">terrible</u> happened to me last year because of my best friend Julie. It sounds crazy but I was <u title="mắc kẹt (ngày 104)">stuck</u> at the bottom of the sea for 36 hours. Yes, at the bottom of the sea! Under water! For 36 hours. Which is more than a day! You’ll see that I’m not <u title="bịa chuyện (ngày 154)">making it up</u> when you hear my whole story.</p>

      <p>It all started when Julie showed me a photo. “Molly, check this out.” </p>

      <p>So I took her phone. Ethan, a guy that Julie met on Instagram, was holding the <mark>steering wheel</mark> of a boat and smiling. I never liked this guy and this photo made me like him even less. It was so obvious that he was just a <mark>spoiled</mark> rich kid. “So?” I said and gave the phone back to her. I could <u title="nhận ra, cảm nhận được (ngày 158)">tell</u> that she wanted something from me. </p>

      <p>“He’s inviting us to spend the weekend on his boat” </p>

      <p>I <u title="giả bộ (ngày 143)">pretended</u> not to understand. “Us? How does he know me? He <u title="gần như không (ngày 304)">barely</u> even knows you. You just message each other.” </p>

      <p>She said “We talked on the phone for hours last night. Trust me, he’s a great guy. Come on, let’s go together.”</p> 

      <p>I immediately said, “No way. What am I going to do on a boat with a total <dfn data-inf="(n) người lạ">stranger</dfn> for 2 days?” </p>

      <p>So she said something she knew would work. “What if he’s a <u title="gã điên (ngày 230)">psycho</u>? Are you going to leave me alone  with a guy like that?” This was the same sentence I used on her last month. I asked her to come with me when I was meeting a guy for the first time. So we went to the date together. She basically meant, “now it’s your turn.” I had to say yes.</p>

      <p>On Saturday morning, we took a 3-hour bus ride to the beach town where Ethan lived. He <dfn data-inf="đã đón chúng tôi">picked us up</dfn> and drove us to the boat. It wasn’t too big but it was so <u title="cao cấp, sang trọng, xa xỉ (ngày 120)">luxurious</u>. There were two <mark>cabins</mark> below <u title="boong tàu (ngày 267)">deck</u>. Julie and I <u title="chiếm (ngày 157)">took over</u> the big one. Ethan didn’t seem like such a bad guy. I thought maybe I was wrong about him. When we came back up, we were surrounded by water, already on our way. Ethan was <mark>steering</mark> the boat. “Please don’t get me wrong but don’t captains drive boats like these?” I asked.</p>

      <p>He smiled. “Don’t worry. This is a small <dfn data-inf="du thuyền">yacht</dfn>. I have a license to drive it. Anyway, we’re not going to drive all the time. We’ll find a good <u title="địa điểm (ngày 83)">spot</u> and <mark>anchor</mark> there.” he said.</p>

      <p>Julie and I sat down to relax in the sun. It wasn’t hot enough to wear a bikini but the sun was still pretty strong. 2 or 3 hours later, we stopped. We anchored next to an island. Nobody lived on that part of the island, so it was just us, the sea, and nature.</p>

      <p>Ethan was a great <u title="chủ nhà (tổ chức sự kiện) (ngày 159)">host</u>. He prepared all the food by himself. It felt like summer <u title="mặc dù (ngày 10)">even though</u> it was the end of November. Julie didn’t drink much but Ethan and I got so drunk we could barely speak. He stood up. “Your captain <u title="sắp (ngày 288)">is about to</u> <u title="ngất (ngày 139)">pass out</u>. I need to go to bed. The boat needs me tomorrow” he said and <u title="loạng choạng (ngày 241)">wobbled</u> his way to his cabin.</p>

      <p>After a while we went back to our cabin as well. I was a little <u title="chóng mặt (ngày 167)">dizzy</u> and got <u title="bực mình (ngày 117)">frustrated</u> with myself for having drunk so much. I remember my head touching the pillow, and I <mark>dozed off</mark> immediately.</p>

      <p>The sea was so calm when we went to bed. I don’t know when the weather <mark>worsened</mark>, and a huge storm began but when I woke up, the yacht was <mark>rocking</mark> a lot. I looked for Julie but she wasn’t in her bed. At first I thought I was dreaming but of course I was not. I heard a <u title="tiếng đập (ngày 315)">pounding noise</u> from below, as if something was hitting the boat. With each hit, the boat would rise up and then quickly fall back down. I knew it wasn’t a good idea to go upstairs in such weather but I had to find Julie. I tried to stand up but it was impossible to stand on my feet.</p>

      <p>Just then, the boat <mark>swung</mark> hard. I tried to hold onto something but I couldn’t. I hit my back against the wall, and screamed in pain. It hurt so much that I was sure I had broken something. The pain stopped after a while. I checked my arms, legs and <mark>ribs</mark>. Nothing hurt and I was <u title="thở phào nhẹ nhõm (ngày 115)">relieved</u> that nothing was broken.</p>

      <p>I suddenly realized the real danger. I was in a boat. There was a terrible storm outside. And boats <u title="thường (ngày 122)">tended to</u> <mark>sink</mark> during storms. What <u title="phải/nên làm gì (ngày 79)">was I supposed to do</u>? Was I supposed to stay down here, or try to go upstairs? I was thinking that the right thing to do was to go outside when the boat started to <mark>rock</mark> even more. It felt like the boat started moving. Had Ethan taken control of the boat? Were we going somewhere safe?</p>

      <p>I was trying to calm myself down when I heard a really loud noise. I realized that the movement was just <u title="do (ngày 10)">due to</u> the boat <mark>drifting</mark>, and we had crashed against the <mark>rocks</mark> surrounding the island. It was now clear what was about to happen: the boat was going to sink. I managed to get up because the boat wasn’t <mark>rocking</mark> as much. I was trying to get to the door when suddenly it <u title="tách (ngày 149)">split</u> in two, and water started pouring into the cabin. It was what I’d been afraid of. We were sinking! The water was pouring in so fast that I couldn’t move through it. I went into the bathroom and shut the door. I took the towels from the <u title="tủ đựng (ngày 202)">cabinet</u>, and <u title="nhét (ngày 69)">stuffed</u> them under the door, but the water kept coming in.</p>

      <p>Until then, I had managed to stay calm. But now I had enough reasons to <u title="hoảng loạn (ngày 292)">panic</u>. The boat I was in had hit a rock in a storm and was sinking quickly. And I was stuck inside a <u title="nhỏ xíu (ngày 115)">tiny</u> bathroom. For the first time, I thought I might actually die. I started yelling to get this thought out of my mind. “Molly, use your brain! Come on! You have to find a way to get out of here. Use your brain!”</p>

      <p>The bathroom kept filling with water, which had by now reached my knees. I stood up on the toilet. It was impossible to get out of here. The water was going to fill up this tiny bathroom soon. I don’t know how much time had passed. I had <mark>resigned myself to</mark> my <u title="số phận (ngày 219)">fate</u>, and was just waiting. The water was now up to my chest.</p> 

      <p>At this point I noticed that the bathroom seemed to be filling up more slowly. Was it a good idea to try to open the door? Or was I supposed to wait until help came? But the water was still rising, <mark>albeit</mark> slower. Would I be able to <dfn data-inf="sống sót">survive</dfn> until someone came to <u title="giải cứu (ngày 252)">rescue</u> me? There was <u title="không có gì đảm bảo (ngày 21)">no guarantee</u> that someone would come. I decided to do a small experiment. I took a deep breath and <u title="lặn xuống (ngày 346)">dived in</u>. I turned <u title="tay nắm cửa (ngày 139)">the door handle</u> and pushed, but the door wouldn’t <mark>budge</mark>. I tried again, but no luck. I came up when I was <u title="hết hơi, không còn nín thở thêm được nữa (ngày 181)">out of breath</u>. Obviously, the boat had sunk. The door wouldn’t open because the cabin was probably full of water. I was still alive and I wasn’t giving up. But what about Julie? </p>

      <p>Until that moment I hadn’t cried but now I started <u title="khóc nức nở (ngày 216)">sobbing</u> and couldn’t stop. Meanwhile, the water had risen more. What’s worse, taking deep breaths while crying had used up a lot of oxygen, and I could feel there wasn’t much of it left. I was in such bad shape that I couldn’t tell how much time had passed.</p>

      <p>The water was now up to my <mark>chin</mark>. I was cold. I was hungry. I was thirsty. I was tired and very sleepy. For a moment I thought, “Let yourself go and let it all end”. As a medical student, I was aware that it was hypothermia that made me think like this. I had been in cold water for a long time so my body temperature had fallen and it was going to continue to fall. I was losing hope that help would come. We weren’t in open water, but who would <u title="tìm kiếm (ngày 59)">look for</u> us? <b><i>Neither</i></b> my parents <b><i>nor</i></b> Julie’s knew that we were here. Would Ethan’s family do something? I didn’t think so. I thought this was the end for me.</p>

      <p>The water continued to rise slowly. It got so high that I had to stand on my toes to avoid <u title="chết đuối (ngày 327)">drowning</u>. Just then I heard a sound. It was like someone had hit something a few times. I <u title="nín thở">held my breath</u>. The sound stopped. Maybe there was no sound. Maybe I was <mark>hallucinating</mark> because I <u title="sắp">was about to</u> <u title="ngất">pass out</u>.</p>

      <p>No! I heard the sound again and this time it was closer. Anyways if I was hallucinating, I would have heard my mom’s voice or something. Why would I hear the sound of metal being hit? I dived into the water one more time. There was a soap dish made of stone. I <u title="bắt lấy (ngày 176)">grabbed</u> it and came back up. I started hitting the wall with it. The other sound stopped. All you could hear was me hitting the wall. I stopped after a while. Then the sound from the outside started again. I was communicating with someone! They knew I was here. They turned out to be two divers from the search and rescue team. At first, they couldn’t open the door because of the <u title="sức ép, áp lực nước (ngày 326)">pressure</u>. But they were there to save me.</p>

      <p>After a while, they managed to get me out of the bathroom and then out of the boat. There were doctors on the search and rescue ship. They had a lot of experience with such situations, and were able to help me <dfn data-inf="hồi phục">recover</dfn> from hypothermia.</p>

      <p>As soon as I was feeling better, I asked about Julie. I found out that both she and Ethan were okay. <u title="Hình như (ngày 41)">Apparently</u>, Ethan had <mark>diabetes</mark>. But he was too drunk to take his insulin shot. Diabetes patients <u title="mất tỉnh táo (ngày 181)">lose consciousness</u> in such situations and go into a <u title="trạng thái hôn mê (ngày 211)">coma</u> after a while. Ethan <u title="bằng cách nào đó (ngày 180)">somehow</u> got himself to our cabin door and knocked. Julie helped him right away. She gave him his insulin shot but he was still feeling very bad.</p> 

      <p>Just then the storm <u title="xảy ra, nổ ra (ngày 353)">broke out</u> so he had no choice but to go upstairs. Julie went up with him too. Thankfully, she thought of putting on their life jackets. Ethan managed to start the engine, but the <u title="các ngọn sóng (ngày 168)">waves</u> were too big, and he couldn’t prevent the boat from drifting. They fell into the water when the boat hit the rocks. Julie never left Ethan’s side. The waves <mark>washed</mark> both of them onto the beach. Ethan had lost consciousness so Julie couldn’t leave him. The next day, a group of hikers accidentally <u title="bắt gặp (ngày 292)">came across</u> them. They are both doing well now.</p>

      <p>After hearing this story, my first reaction was: “They’ll <u title="chắc chắn (ngày 141)">definitely</u> get married after going through this together.” After a <u title="kinh hoàng (ngày 298)">horrific</u> 36 hours, I managed to come back to life. I think I did pretty well over all. Of course I got very lucky, but deciding to go into the bathroom, managing to stay calm, fighting the hypothermia… I definitely <u title="xứng đáng (ngày 16)">deserve</u> a ‘well done’!</p>
