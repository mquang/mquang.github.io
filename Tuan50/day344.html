      <p>Hello! Let me introduce myself — my name is Lily, I’m nineteen years old, and I am the most <mark>naive</mark> person in the world. No, seriously, I’m just a <u title="kẻ khờ, kẻ ngu ngốc (ngày 308)">fool</u>, who was easily <u title="bị lừa (ngày 338)">deceived</u> by some <mark>marriage swindlers</mark>. And the fact that I was born and raised in a small town doesn't <u title="bào chữa cho (ngày 172)">justify</u> my foolishness - I am still very ashamed to tell my story. But I want to be honest from the beginning to the end. Because an honest and <mark>noble</mark> person was the one who saved me.</p>

      <p>When I turned eighteen, I suddenly found out that my grandfather, who died when I was a little kid, had left me a good sum of money. There was a <mark>clause</mark>, however, that I could spend this money in only one way — to pay for my studies at a university. But I was still very happy! Before I found out about the money, my <mark>prospects</mark> for the future were limited to routine work on my parents’ farm, but now I could get an education and figure out how to modernize our family business! My parents did not understand my choice, they <u title="mắng, trách (ngày 216)">scolded</u> my <mark>deceased</mark> grandfather for hiding this money from them, and me - because I wanted to leave for the big city. But I was determined. Moreover, my grandfather left me a detailed financial plan on how I should split the money to cover <i><b>not only</b></i> my <u title="học phí (ngày 90)">tuition fees</u> and small apartment rent, <i><b>but also</b></i> <u title="(v) giảm bớt (ngày 245)">moderate</u> <u title="các chi phí phải bỏ tiền túi ra để trả (ngày 195 + 7)">pocket expenses</u>.</p>

      <p>I was very <u title="hứng thú (ngày 107)">enthusiastic</u> about my new life and felt absolutely happy. I had no friends at the university or in the whole city, but I was fine with it. I knew that other students <u title="cho là, coi là (ngày 261)">perceived</u> me as a silly girl. But it was only their opinion, so I didn't pay any attention to it.</p>

      <p>Everything was fine... until I got attacked on the street. I was on my way home from the library late in the evening. I was listening to music with my headphones on and reading something on my smartphone. So I did not notice the group of guys surrounding me before it was already too late. There were four of these guys, and their faces were covered by <mark>bandanas</mark>. I froze and could not <u title="nói nên lời (ngày 220)">utter a sound</u>. One of them <u title="giật (ngày 236)">snatched</u> my handbag from my hands and the other took my smartphone. But when I got really scared was the moment when the third guy <u title="túm lấy (ngày 176)">grabbed</u> my hair and <u title="khen ngợi (ngày 11)">complimented</u> my “pretty face” in a <mark>sinister</mark> voice. I <u title="hoảng loạn (ngày 292)">panicked</u>, I <dfn data-inf="kêu lên, hét lên">cried out</dfn>, “Leave me alone!”, I even <u title="òa khóc">burst into tears</u>! I was never taught how to <mark>stand up for myself</mark>, so the only thing I could do was to pray for help...</p>

      <p>And my prayer was heard...help actually came. Some <u title="nhanh nhẹn, lanh lợi (ngày 253)">nimble</u> girl suddenly jumped out of the darkness, like a <mark>superheroine</mark>. She screamed in a scary voice and <u title="-ed of swear<br>chửi thề, chửi rủa">swore</u>, mixing Spanish and English, with a strong Hispanic accent as she yelled. I could hardly understand what she was talking about, but it seemed like she had <u title="đe dọa (ngày 176)">threatened</u> the <u title="những tên cướp (ngày 179)">robbers</u> to call the police. She was very <mark>fiercely</mark> swinging her bag and, it seemed to me, she had even hit a couple of the <u title="gã côn đồ, du côn (ngày 318)">thugs</u> on their heads! Anyway, the robbers <mark>retreated</mark> under this girl’s <u title="áp lực (ngày 326)">pressure</u>... like they <u title="-ed of flee<br>bỏ chạy">fled</u>, leaving my stuff on the ground. I burst into tears again, this time from <u title="nhẹ nhõm (ngày 115)">relief</u>, and I hugged my <u title="vị cứu tinh (ngày 325)">savior</u>.</p> 

      <p>This was how I met Ramona. It turned out that she studied at the same university as me, and, like me, was kind of an <mark>outsider</mark> among students. They made fun of Ramona because of her broken English. She, in turn, had too much <mark>dignity</mark> to make any complaints to the administration. I admired her character and her courage. We became best friends and I soon asked her if she wanted to live together with me in the apartment I rented.</p> 

      <p>Living with Ramona was fun and interesting, she always found ways to <u title="an ủi, động viên (ngày 207)">cheer me up</u>. And when Ramona suddenly became silent and sad, I easily understood that my bestie had some problems. I wanted to be a good friend to Ramona, so I did not wait for her to come out of her <mark>funk</mark>, and rushed to find out what had happened and how I could help.</p>

      <p>It turned out that Ramona was upset because of her cousin Fernando. Well, at this point I found out that Ramona didn't come to the USA alone, but she was <u title="đi theo cùng bởi (ngày 8)">accompanied by</u> her cousin! But Fernando, unlike his cousin, did not get accepted to the university. He was running out of money and soon he would have no choice but to return to his small town in Colombia. Ramona was worried that Fernando would not be able to save money for a second <u title="lần cố gắng (ngày 13)">attempt</u> to come to the United States <u title="trong công cuộc tìm kiếm (ngày 200)">in search of</u> a better life.</p>

      <p>I still felt like I owed Ramona at least a favor, so I said that we could invite Fernando to stay with us in this apartment, especially considering that we had a spare room. At first, Ramona did not believe that I would really do that. But as soon she realized that I really meant it, she was so happy and she immediately called her cousin. This day did not even come to an end before Fernando was standing at the door with his suitcase.</p>

      <p>When the bell rang, Ramona was making dinner, so I went to open the door. And as soon as I let him in... he suddenly attacked me with kisses! Well, I mean ... these were light kisses on the cheeks, but for me, it was so unexpected that I was totally lost. And also very embarrassed. I had never experienced this kind of physical <u title="sự thân mật (ngày 182)">intimacy</u> with a guy, <mark>let alone</mark> the guy I just met for the first time in my life. And when Ramona came out from the kitchen and <mark>set me free</mark> from her cousin's arms, I was finally able to raise my eyes up from the floor and that's when I saw that Fernando was incredibly handsome! I was glad that Ramona was standing next to me, <u title="nếu không thì (ngày 118)">otherwise</u> I would not have been able to say a word <mark>in his presence</mark>!</p>

      <p>We spent our first evening getting to know each other in a relaxed and friendly manner. However, I could not help but steal looks at Fernando <u title="thi thoảng (ngày 321)">every once in a while</u>. At his beautiful hair, muscular arms, at his powerful <mark>torso</mark> under his thin t-shirt ... oh. I tried very hard to think of Fernando like he was just a friend, but I had to face the truth — I had a crush on this guy.</p>

      <p>Well, from that day on, the life of the three of us together had started! From the very beginning, I decided that we wouldn’t split the costs of rent and food. Ramona and Fernando did not have any money at all, I was much luckier <mark>in this regard</mark>, so I decided that I would pay for everything. My friends realized that I was taking care of them, and tried to live quite <u title="1 cách khiêm tốn (ngày 216)">modestly</u>. They seemed to be such good friends for me!</p>

      <p>But soon Fernando destroyed our friendship. Because he wanted more from me! In less than a few weeks, he began <u title="tán tỉnh (ngày 221)">courting</u> me. He was showing me really clear signs of attention that I couldn’t pretend I didn’t notice. When Fernando finally made his move, I realized that I could <u title="không thể ... lâu hơn được nữa (ngày 76)">no longer</u> <u title="từ chối (ngày 218)">resist</u>. I wanted us to become a couple! I shared my thoughts with Ramona. I thought she would be happy if her best friend and cousin became a couple... and yes, she supported me! But only <mark>verbally</mark>.</p>

      <p>When Fernando and I started to behave like a couple, she clearly <mark>got in our way</mark>! You see ... Fernando was a passionate guy and took every chance to hug me and kiss me, and I saw that he was ready to go further as soon as possible ... I wasn’t ready for that yet, but I welcomed his signs of <u title="tình cảm, sự yêu mến (ngày 182)">affection</u>. But Ramona wouldn’t leave us alone for more than ten minutes! She kept coming in my room all the time without knocking, she accompanied Fernando and me anywhere we would go, whether it was to the movies or to a coffee shop. She would even try to sit between me and Fernando, so that we could not hug or hold hands!</p>

      <p>Finally, I had enough and decided to find out what was wrong. We talked and Ramona told me that she was raised in a <u title="bảo thủ (ngày 23)">conservative</u> family and simply could not allow anything to happen between unmarried people <mark>in her presence</mark>! Suddenly, Fernando entered the room where we were talking and did not even try to pretend that he was not <u title="đang nghe lén (ngày 211)">eavesdropping</u>. He stated that if this was the only problem, then he was ready to marry me as soon as possible! Fernando proposed to me and, of course, I said yes!</p>

      <p>We set up the closest possible wedding date, and Fernando moved out of our apartment until the ceremony. He wanted to do everything right! Ramona and I decided to have a <mark>bachelorette party</mark> just for the two of us. We spent a day at the spa and then had dinner at a nice restaurant. I wanted us to take a walk back home to breathe in the fresh air and enjoy the lights of the city at night. When Ramona and I passed a nightclub, I noticed a <u title="đáng nghi (ngày 276)">suspiciously</u> familiar group of guys near the <dfn data-inf="(n) cổng vào">entrance</dfn>. It seemed to me that they were ... those same robbers who Ramona has saved me from! And it seemed to me that my Fernando was standing next to them! I grabbed Ramona by the elbow to <u title="thu hút sự chú ý của cô ấy về phía họ (ngày 234)">draw her attention to them</u>, but she suddenly <u title="kéo (ngày 319)">dragged</u> me in the opposite direction. We crossed the road in front of the moving cars and then Ramona caught a taxi and literally pushed me into it. I didn’t understand anything, but Ramona said that we didn’t need to find out if those were the same guys, <u title="để (ngày 22)">in order to</u> avoid any problems. And she called me stupid for thinking that one of them was Fernando. It was really odd and painful. Ramona had never been so <u title="thô lỗ (ngày 111)">rude</u> to me.</p> 

      <p>The truth was revealed on the very next day. My wedding ceremony with Fernando was interrupted by the most <u title="nực cười (ngày 304)">ridiculous</u> way! A noisy emotional Colombian woman, who turned out to be Ramona's mother, rushed in and pulled Fernando away from me. She explained in bad English that these two, Ramona and Fernando, were not cousins, but lovers! They wanted to move to the United States together, and when Fernando’s visa was about to expire, they decided that he should marry an American in order to avoid <mark>deportation</mark>. All this was Ramona’s plan ... she noticed a silly girl at her university, persuaded Fernando's friends to <u title="dàn cảnh, sắp đặt (ngày 188)">stage</u> an attack on me, and after that, they played out the whole <mark>charade</mark> together!</p>

      <p>But Ramona’s mother did not support her daughter’s <u title="xấu xa (ngày 322)">vicious</u> plans, and as soon as she found out how far things had gone, she borrowed money for a flight to the US and came to my wedding to protect me from making a huge mistake. It was Ramona’s mother - the very honest and <mark>noble</mark> person who saved me... From everything except a broken heart. And this is something more than just not being successful in love...</p>

      <p>Since my failed wedding I live alone, I don’t communicate with anyone except my teachers, I don’t trust anyone, and I don’t want to make any friends ever again.</p>
