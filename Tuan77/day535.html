       <p>This is the new one-<u title="liều thuốc (ngày 347)">dose</u> Covid-19 vaccine
from Johnson & Johnson.

In early March,
more than 6,000 doses

<u title="đáng lẽ ra, đúng ra (theo như kì vọng) (ngày 79)">were supposed to</u> <mark>be shipped</mark>
to the city of Detroit, Michigan.

But the <u title="ngài thị trưởng (ngày 1)">mayor</u> said, no thanks.

"Moderna and Pfizer are the best.

And I am going to do
everything I can

to make sure the <u title="cư dân (ngày 26)">residents</u>
of the city of Detroit get the best."

He was <u title="nhắc đến (ngày 38)">referring to</u> these numbers:
the vaccines’ "<mark>efficacy rates</mark>."

The vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech
and Moderna have super high efficacy rates:

95 and 94 percent.

But Johnson & Johnson?
Just 66%.

And if you only look at these numbers,
it’s natural to think that these vaccines

are worse than these.

But that <u title="giả định, điều cho rằng, tưởng rằng là đúng (ngày 171)">assumption</u> is wrong.

These numbers are <u title="có thể được cho là (ngày 203)">arguably</u>
not even the most important measure

of how effective
these vaccines are.

To understand what is, you first have to understand
what vaccines are even supposed to do.</p><p>

A vaccine’s efficacy rate
is calculated in large <u title="thử nghiệm lâm sàng (ngày 62)">clinical trials</u>,

when the vaccine is tested
on tens of thousands of people.

Those people are broken into two groups:

half get the vaccine,
and half get a <mark>placebo</mark>.

Then, they’re sent out
to live their lives,

while scientists <u title="theo dõi (ngày 394)">monitor</u> whether or not
they get Covid-19 over several months.

In the trial for Pfizer/BioNTech, for
example, there were 43,000 <u title="người tham gia (ngày 2)">participants</u>.

In the end, 170 people
<u title="bị lây nhiễm (ngày 269)">were infected</u> with Covid-19.

And how those people fall into each of these
groups <u title="xác định (ngày 172)">determines</u> a vaccine’s efficacy.

If the 170 <u title="được chia đều (ngày 149)">were evenly split</u>,

that would mean you’re just as likely
to get sick with the vaccine as without it.

So it would have a 0% efficacy.

If all 170 were in the placebo group, and
zero people who got the vaccine were sick,

the vaccine would have
an efficacy of 100%.

With this particular trial,
there were 162 in the placebo group,

and just eight
in the vaccine group.

It means those who had the vaccine
were 95% less likely to get Covid-19:

The vaccine had a 95% efficacy.

Now, this doesn’t mean that if 100 people
are vaccinated, 5 of them will get sick.

Instead, that 95% number
applies to the <u title="mỗi cá nhân (ngày 105)">individual</u>.

So, each vaccinated person is 95% less likely
than a person without a vaccine

to get sick, each time
they’<u title="ở trong điều kiện, hoàn cảnh, môi trường đầy virus, dễ bị lây nhiễm (ngày 325)">re exposed to</u> Covid-19.

And every vaccine’s efficacy rate
is calculated in the same way.

But each vaccine’s trial might be done in
very different <u title="điều kiện, hoàn cảnh (ngày 184)">circumstances</u>.</p><p>

"So, one of the biggest considerations here,
when we look at these numbers,

is the timing in which
these clinical trials were performed."

This is the number of daily Covid-19 cases
in the US since the <u title="đại dịch (ngày 388)">pandemic</u> began. 

The Moderna trial was done
completely in the US, here, in the summer. 

The Pfizer/BioNTech trial was <u title="chủ yếu (ngày 350)">primarily</u>
based in the US, too, and at the same time.

Johnson & Johnson, however,
held their US trial at this time,

when there were more opportunities
for participants to <u title="ở trong điều kiện, hoàn cảnh, môi trường đầy virus, dễ bị lây nhiễm (ngày 325)">be exposed to</u> infections.

And most of their trial took place in other
countries, primarily South Africa and Brazil.

And in these other countries,
not only were case <mark>rates</mark> high,

but the virus itself
was different.

The trials <u title="diễn ra (ngày 19)">took place</u>
<u title="trong khi (ngày 194)">as</u> <u title="những biến thể (ngày 72)">variants</u> of Covid-19 <u title="xuất hiện (ngày 380)">emerged</u>, 

and became the <u title="mạnh mẽ<br>(more important, powerful or easy to notice than other things)<br>(ngày 248)">dominant</u> infections
in these countries;

variants that are more likely 
to get participants sick. 

In South Africa, most of the cases in the
Johnson & Johnson trial were that of the variant,

not the <u title="chủng (virus) ban đầu (ngày 81 + 412)">original strain</u> that was
in the US over the summer.

And <u title="mặc dù (ngày 10)">despite</u> that, it still
<u title="đáng kể (ngày 50)">significantly</u> reduced infections.</p><p>

"If you're trying to make one-to-one, 
head-to-head comparisons between vaccines,

they need to have been studied in the
same trial, with the same <mark>inclusion</mark> <u title="các tiêu chí (ngày 255)">criteria</u>,

in the same parts of the world,
at the same time."</p><p>

"If we were to take
Pfizer and Moderna's vaccines,

and redo their clinical trial at the same time
that we saw J&J's clinical trial,

 we might see quite different
efficacy numbers for those."</p><p>

These efficacy numbers really just tell you
what happened in each vaccine’s trial, 

not exactly what will happen in the real world.

But many experts argue this isn’t even the
best number to judge a vaccine by anyway.

Because preventing any infection at all is
not always the point of a vaccine.</p><p>

"The goal of a vaccine program for Covid-19
is not necessarily to get to 'Covid zero,'

but it's to <mark>tame</mark> this virus, to <mark>defang</mark> it, 

to remove its ability to cause
serious disease, <u title="sự (phải) nhập viện (ngày 521)">hospitalization</u>, and death."</p><p>

It helps to look at the different <u title="kết quả (ngày 261)">outcomes</u>
of an exposure to Covid-19 like this:

The best-case <u title="viễn cảnh, tình huống, kịch bản (ngày 266)">scenario</u>
is, you don’t get sick at all.

The worst case is death.

In between, there’s being hospitalized,
<u title="nghiêm trọng (ngày 16)">severe</u>-to-<u title="vừa vừa (ngày 245)">moderate</u> symptoms,

or having no symptoms at all.

In the absolute best circumstances, vaccines
give you protection all the way to here.

But realistically, that isn’t the
main <u title="mục tiêu (ngày 483)">objective</u> of Covid-19 vaccines.

The real purpose is to give your body enough
protection to cover these possibilities,

so if you do get an infection,
it feels more like a cold

than something you'd be
hospitalized for.

And this is one thing that every one
of these Covid-19 vaccines do well.

In all these trials, while some people in
the placebo groups were hospitalized,

or even died from Covid-19,

not one fully vaccinated person,
in any of these trials,

was hospitalized or died from Covid-19.</p><p>

"One thing that I wish that mayor
would have understood,

was that all three vaccines have essentially
100% effectiveness in protecting from death."</p><p>

The mayor of Detroit did <mark>backtrack</mark>, and said
he’d start taking Johnson & Johnson doses,

because it’s still "highly effective against
what we care about most."

Efficacy matters.
But it doesn’t matter the most.

The question isn’t which vaccine will protect
you from any Covid infection,

but which one will keep you <u title="sống sót (ngày 437)">alive</u>?

Or out of the hospital?

Which one will help end the pandemic?

And that’s any of them.</p><p>

"The best vaccine right now for you
is the one that you'<u title="được cấp (ngày 72)">re offered</u>."</p><p>

"With each shot that goes into someone's arm,
we get closer to the end of this pandemic."
