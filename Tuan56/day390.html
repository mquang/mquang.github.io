      <p>SCOTT SIMON, HOST: <mark>Lung</mark> <u title="phẫu thuật cấy ghép (ngày 353)">transplants</u> have saved the lives of a small number of COVID patients, and Mayra Ramirez is the first in the U.S. to get a double-lung transplant. It was back in June, but Ms. Ramirez only recently shared her <u title="danh tính (ngày 247)">identity</u> and her <mark>extraordinary</mark> story with Christine Herman of Illinois Public Media.</p>

      <p>CHRISTINE HERMAN, BYLINE: Before the pandemic <u title="-ed of strike<br>xảy ra (ngày 272)">struck</u>, Mayra Ramirez had built a life for herself in Chicago. She was 28 and worked as a <mark>paralegal</mark> at an <u title="công ty luật di trú, nhập cư (ngày 169 + 67)">immigration law firm</u>. She loved <dfn data-inf="dắt chó của cô ấy&#10;đi dạo">walking her dogs</dfn> and <u title="tụ tập bạn bè tán ngẫu, chém gió (ngày 139)">hanging out</u> with her boyfriend. When Illinois's governor issued a stay-at-home order in March, it was easy for her to work from home. She hardly ever went outside. Mayra does have a <mark>neurological condition</mark> that she manages with a medication that could have <mark>suppressed</mark> her <u title="hệ miễn dịch (ngày 353)">immune system</u>, but otherwise, she's healthy. And to this day, she has no idea how she got the coronavirus. It happened sometime in early April.</p>

      <p>MAYRA RAMIREZ: I lost sense of taste and smell. I felt very <mark>fatigued</mark>. I was not able to walk long distances. And that's when I decided to go into the emergency room.</p>

      <p>HERMAN: Her oxygen levels were extremely low, and Mayra was given 10 minutes to call her mom to explain she was about to be placed on a <mark>ventilator</mark>.</p>

      <p>RAMIREZ: In Spanish, the word ventilator, (speaking Spanish), is like fan. And so I thought, oh, they're just going to blow some air into me and I'll be OK, maybe have a three-day stay. So I wasn't very worried.</p>

      <p>HERMAN: But, in fact, she'd spend the next six weeks heavily <mark>sedated</mark> with life support machines doing the work of her lungs and heart. She had <u title="kinh hãi (ngày 232)">terrifying</u> dreams that she couldn't <u title="phân biệt (ngày 30)">distinguish</u> from reality.</p>

      <p>RAMIREZ: Most of them <u title="bao gồm, chứa đựng (cảnh) (ngày 37)">involved</u> me <u title="chết ngạt (ngày 327)">drowning</u>, and I <mark>attribute that to me not being able to breathe</mark>. I had way worse nightmares than that, but I don't wish to share those because they're very <u title="rõ ràng (ngày 196)">explicit</u>.</p>

      <p>HERMAN: In early June, Mayra's family was told she may not make it through the night, so they flew in from North Carolina to say goodbye. Then the doctors said they could try a double-lung transplant. Her mother, Nohemi Romero, agreed. She spoke at a recent press conference about the experience.</p>

      <p>NOHEMI ROMERO: (Speaking Spanish).</p>

      <p>HERMAN: She said there are no words to describe the pain of not being by her daughter's side as she struggled for her life and that God gave her the strength to make it through. Northwestern Medicine's Dr. Ankit Bharat performed the 10-hour <u title="ca phẫu thuật (ngày 9)">procedure</u>.</p>

      <p>ANKIT BHARAT: Most patients are quite sick going into lung transplant, but she was so sick - in fact, I can say <u title="không chút do dự (ngày 93)">without hesitation</u> the sickest patient I've transplanted.</p>

      <p>HERMAN: Mayra was extremely sick, but she was also young, just 28. And <dfn data-inf="ngoài">aside from</dfn> her lungs, her other <u title="các cơ quan (ngày 351)">organs</u> were <u title="khá là (ngày 291)">relatively</u> OK. Bharat says most COVID-19 patients are not like Mayra. They're not candidates for transplants because of their age and other <mark>chronic health problems</mark> that make it less likely a transplant will succeed.<br>

      When Mayra first woke up, she was <mark>disoriented</mark>. She couldn't move or talk. It would be weeks before she understood what had happened to her. She's doing better now but probably faces at least a year of <u title="liệu pháp phục hồi (ngày 224 + 220)">rehab therapy</u> before she can <mark>function</mark> <u title="1 cách độc lập (ngày 173)">independently</u>.</p>

      <p>ROMERO: At this time, I'm not certain of the permanent damage that's been made to my body. I don't even want to begin to talk about the <mark>pills</mark> because there are so many.</p>

      <p>HERMAN: Seventeen different pills, some of them several times a day. Some are to prevent her body from <u title="từ chối (ngày 42)">rejecting</u> the new lungs. And she also takes <u title="trầm cảm, tuyệt vọng (ngày 226)">depression</u> and <u title="lo lắng (ngày 97)">anxiety</u> <mark>meds</mark> because she has so many nightmares and <u title="cơn hoảng loạn (ngày 292)">panic attacks</u>.</p>

      <p>RAMIREZ: Slowly but surely I'm able to get through them with the help of therapy. It's just something that I don't want to <u title="hồi tưởng, nhớ lại, sống lại cảm giác (ngày 234)">relive</u> ever again.</p>

      <p>HERMAN: COVID-19 has <mark>disproportionately</mark> harmed Latinos, who are <mark>overrepresented</mark> in <u title="các công việc có mức lương thấp (ngày 33)">low-wage jobs</u> that <u title="đặt họ vào hoàn cảnh nhiều mối nguy hiểm rình rập (dễ bị lây nhiễm virus) (ngày 325)">expose</u> them to the virus and are more likely to lack social protections, like <u title="bảo hiểm y tế (ngày 21)">health insurance</u>. Even with her work-from-home job, Mayra wasn't <mark>spared</mark>. And while insurance <u title="chi trả (ngày 70)">covered</u> some of her hospitalization, she still <mark>owes</mark> tens of thousands of dollars in medical bills. Mayra is <u title="háo hức (ngày 71)">eager</u> to get back to her job and her life. She's even asked her <u title="bác sĩ phẫu thuật (ngày 102)">surgeon</u> to take her <u title="nhảy dù (ngày 346)">skydiving</u> someday.</p>

      <p>RAMIREZ: It's funny because Dr. Bharat actually used to work at a skydiving company when he was younger. And so he promised me that hopefully within a year he can get me there.</p>

      <p>HERMAN: And she has every intention of holding him to that promise.
