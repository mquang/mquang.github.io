      <p>SCOTT SIMON, HOST:

<mark>Wildfires</mark> continue to burn up and down the West Coast this weekend from the San Bernardino National Forest in Southern California to western Oregon. The rain helps <mark>tamp</mark> some of the <mark>blazes</mark>. Carol Berger and her husband, Fred, lost their home in Talent, Ore., just outside Ashland when the Almeda Fire swept through their town. She joins us now from the Elks Lodge in Ashland, where they've been providing meals and support. Carol, thank you for being with us.</p>

<p>CAROL BERGER: I'm happy to be here.</p>

<p>SIMON: Well, tell us what you've been through. I understand you and your husband had <mark>duffel bags</mark> <u title="đã được đóng gói đồ đạc sẵn sàng (ngày 137)">packed</u> and emergency supplies <mark>stashed</mark> under your bed.</p>

<p>BERGER: Yes, we did. I went to an emergency preparedness training two years ago and followed instructions.</p>

<p>SIMON: So I am told a week ago Tuesday around 11 a.m. you got <dfn data-inf="lệnh">the order</dfn> to <u title="sơ tán (ngày 290)">evacuate</u>, but you had to do a couple of things first - a couple of important things - didn't you?</p>

<p>BERGER: Yes. We had heard that my 93-year-old mother, who is in a <u title="cơ sở chăm sóc những người (già) mắc chứng suy giảm trí nhớ (ngày 60)">memory care facility</u> 10 minutes away from me - I got a phone call saying there was a fire within reach of their building, and could I come and help evacuate?</p>

<p>SIMON: Oh, no.</p>

<p>BERGER: I live 10 minutes away. And so we <u title="gấp rút đến đó (ngày 209)">rushed</u> there to <u title="giải cứu (ngày 252)">rescue</u> my mom.</p>

<p>SIMON: And she was there, and she was all right.</p>

<p>BERGER: Someone had already come to their assistance. The <u title="các cư dân (ngày 26)">residents</u> were all <u title="được đưa lên xe (ngày 185)">loaded in vans</u> and ready to go. So my husband and I were able to immediately return home and begin to evacuate ourselves.</p>

<p>SIMON: And you had to take another important member of the family with you, didn't you?</p>

<p>BERGER: Our little dog, Skipper, yes.</p>

<p>SIMON: So as you were evacuating, what were you seeing?</p>

<p>BERGER: As we drove away from the house, I could see <dfn data-inf="(ns) ngọn lửa">flames</dfn> in the field right beside our street. I really had no time to do anything <u title="ngoài việc (ngày 120)">but</u> speed away.</p>

<p>SIMON: And what happened then?</p>

<p>BERGER: We were pretty sure our house was gone, but we stayed there until <mark>sheriff</mark> came up and said that we all needed to evacuate to Central Point to the <mark>fairgrounds</mark>. There was going to be a <mark>staging area</mark> there.<br>

So we were - they were <mark>milling around</mark>. There were people in all <dfn data-inf="(ns) trạng thái (tâm&#10;lý, cảm xúc)">states</dfn> of <u title="lo lắng (ngày 97)">anxiety</u> and <u title="đau buồn, đau đớn (ngày 132)">distress</u>. We were very <u title="ý thức được, nhận thức được (nguy cơ lây nhiễm) (ngày 181)">conscious</u> of COVID, and so we were kind of afraid to go into the <u title="khán phòng, khán đài (ngày 366)">auditorium</u> where people were <u title="tập trung (ngày 197)">gathered</u>. We just hung outside and waited for information as it would come <mark>dribbling</mark> in.</p>

<p>SIMON: What was your <mark>frame of mind</mark> like?</p>

<p>BERGER: Surprisingly calm. I'm an <dfn data-inf="bác sĩ vật lí trị liệu&#10;(giúp bệnh nhân hồi phục thông&#10;qua các liệu pháp vận động)">occupational therapist</dfn>, and my career was at the Department of <mark>Veterans</mark> Affairs working with <mark>veterans</mark> coming back from Iraq and with <u title="các chấn thương về mặt nhận thức (ngày 379)">cognitive injuries</u>. And I had a lot of <u title="chiến lược, cách (ngày 261)">strategies</u> for being calm, focused. And I got to <u title="to do the things that I advise other people to do">practice what I <mark>preached</mark></u>.<br>

And my husband is a <dfn data-inf="nhân viên y tế xã hội,&#10;chuyên giải quyết các vấn đề,&#10;chứng bệnh về tâm lý">clinical social worker</dfn> <u title="đã nghỉ hưu (ngày 192)">retired</u> from the VA, and his work was with homeless people. So we felt pretty confident that with his knowledge of resources, we would know who to go to and what to do.</p>

<p>SIMON: Carol, may I ask, what about your home?</p>

<p>BERGER: <u title="Bụi (ngày 51)">Dust</u> and <mark>ashes</mark> and <mark>rubble</mark> - there's absolutely nothing left. It was an extremely hot fire, they say. Nothing was <u title="nhận ra được (đã bị biến dạng) (ngày 55)">recognizable</u>. Even - I could see people had safes - big metal <dfn data-inf="két sắt">safes</dfn> - you know, the kind you just put all your important papers in. And I did have one friend who was so happy when she saw it still there. And she opened it, and everything inside was ash. It was that hot.</p>

<p>SIMON: What kind of shape will the town be in, do you think?</p>

<p>BERGER: Our entire side of the street for several miles is completely destroyed. <u title="Ngay phía bên kia (đối diện)">Right across</u> the street, everything is <mark>untouched</mark> and <mark>pristine</mark>. On that side of the street, many of the residents are low-income, Section 8 housing, <u title="cộng đồng những người nhập cư (ngày 169)">immigrant communities</u>, elderly and disabled. And thank God they're the ones who were not touched at all. The city center was untouched.

The community will go on. And I think what's wonderful is, you know, if we have restaurants and coffeehouses and places to gather, we will remain a community. There's signs all over the place that says, Talent Strong, and I really feel that people are taking that to heart.</p>

<p>SIMON: Carol Berger of Talent, Ore., thank you. And good luck to you and your husband and everybody in town.</p>

<p>BERGER: Thank you so much.</p>
