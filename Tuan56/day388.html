       <p>LEILA FADEL, HOST:

      There's been <mark>a barrage of</mark> bad economic news this week, including the biggest ever drop in GDP. But when big companies announced their earnings to investors, some of them revealed they've been making huge profits during this very <u title="(tụt giảm, suy thoái) nhanh<br>(rising or falling quickly, not gradually) (ngày 161)">steep</u> economic <mark>recession</mark>. NPR's Camila Domonoske joins us now. She's a reporter for our business desk. Good morning, Camila.<p>
      
      <p>CAMILA DOMONOSKE, BYLINE: Hi, Leila.<p>
      
      <p>FADEL: So who's making money during this <u title="khủng hoảng kinh tế (ngày 112)">economic disaster</u>?<p>
      
      <p>DOMONOSKE: Well, Procter & Gamble made a lot of money selling cleaning products, but the big winner was Big Tech. Apple CEO Tim Cook was almost <u title="cảm thấy có lỗi (ngày 65)">apologetic</u> about how much money his company made - I mean, almost. Here he is on <mark>an earnings call</mark>.<p>
      
      <p>TIM COOK: We're <u title="nhận thức, ý thức được (ngày 181)">conscious</u> of the fact that these results stand in <mark>stark relief</mark> during <u title="thời kì kinh tế thực sự khó khăn">a time of real economic adversity</u> for businesses large and small and certainly for families.<p>
      
      <p>DOMONOSKE: And it <u title="hợp lý, là điều dễ hiểu (ngày 201)">makes sense</u>, right? If we're all spending more time staying home, that's more time on our devices. Less time face-to-face means more time on Facebook means more money for Facebook. And, of course, there's online shopping for Amazon. The last few months have been a <mark>bonanza</mark>. <u title="tổng thu nhập (ngày 33)">Revenue</u> went up by 40%, which is just absolutely <u title="rất nhiều, (là 1 con số) rất lớn (ngày 189)">enormous</u>.<br>
      
      And, you know, it's not just <u title="hệ quả (ngày 55)">the effect</u> of the <mark>pandemic</mark>. These companies were <u title="chi phối, thống lĩnh, đứng đầu (thị trường) (ngày 248)">dominating</u> before this <u title="khủng hoảng (ngày 98)">crisis</u>. And just this week, they got <mark>fresh</mark> <mark>scrutiny</mark> from Congress for just how big and powerful they are.<p>
      
      <p>FADEL: Of course, Apple, Facebook, Amazon - all <u title="các nhà tài trợ (ngày 93)">financial sponsors</u> of NPR. Camila, tell us who's <u title="chật vật (ngày 263)">struggling</u>.<p>
      
      <p>DOMONOSKE: Most of the economy is struggling, has taken an absolutely huge hit. Travel and hospitality companies, oil companies - Chevron and Exxon lost billions of dollars - and some smaller companies have entered <u title="sự phá sản (ngày 117)">bankruptcy</u>. A lot of manufacturers are struggling. Ford and GM <u title="mất mát, lỗ (1 lượng lớn) (ngày 375)">racked up</u> losses. If you think about it, any company that <u title="phụ thuộc vào (ngày 173)">relies on</u> people moving around, like airlines, or gathering together, like hotels or even just physical stores, they're struggling. And that's <u title="1 phần/1 mảng lớn (ngày 169)">a huge chunk of</u> the economy.<p>
      
      <p>FADEL: So we've been talking about these big companies, but what about small ones?<p>
      
      <p>DOMONOSKE: Yeah, small businesses have been hit really hard by this crisis. And, you know, early in the pandemic, a lot of local restaurants and shops, they closed their doors, but they said it was <u title="tạm thời (ngày 9)">temporary</u>, right? They were planning on reopening. Right now, according to Yelp, more than half of local business closures are <u title="lâu dài (ngày 9)">permanent</u>. Sameera Fazili is with the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, which has been talking to communities across the South.<p>
      
      <p>SAMEERA FAZILI: I think in March and April, there was more hope that things were going to get better sooner.<p>
      
      <p>DOMONOSKE: That hope has <mark>faded</mark>. In a survey released this week, most small-business owners don't expect the economy to <dfn data-inf="phục hồi">recover</dfn> until next year at the earliest. And Fazili says minority-owned small businesses were especially <u title="dễ bị ảnh hưởng, tổn hại (ngày 182)">vulnerable</u> coming into the crisis.<p>
      
      <p>FADEL: So what does this mean for workers?<p>
      
      <p>DOMONOSKE: Well, for workers at companies in crisis, it's meant huge numbers of <u title="cho thôi việc (ngày 348)">layoffs</u> and the <u title="đáng kinh ngạc (ngày 339)">astonishingly</u> high unemployment numbers that we've seen, with millions of people struggling without jobs. The situation is also affecting workers at the companies that are doing well. When unemployment is low, workers have more <u title="tiếng nói, sức ảnh hưởng (ngày 257)">leverage</u>. They can push for higher wages. That was actually starting to happen right before the pandemic hit. But when there are <u title="rất nhiều (ngày 169)">tons of</u> people <u title="rất cần (ngày 117)">desperate</u> for work, employers can keep pay low. Elise Gould is with the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, and she says right now, with so many people looking for jobs...<p>
      
      <p>ELISE GOULD: You're not really going to see some of those earnings gains actually translate into wage growth for most workers in this country.<p>
      
      <p>DOMONOSKE: And, in fact, lots of people have taken <u title="cắt giảm lương (ngày 300)">pay cuts</u> or <mark>furloughs</mark> to keep their jobs.<p>
      
      <p>FADEL: That's NPR's Camila Domonoske. Thanks, Camila.<p>
      
      <p>DOMONOSKE: Thanks, Leila.</p>
