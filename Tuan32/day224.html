        <p>Hey, guys, my name's Chris. Recently I had to choose between who goes to prison: my dad or my brother. But I'm 13 years old, how can I even make that choice?</p>

        <p>We lived a normal life, but when I was 10 years old, my mother died, and our family changed a lot. We <mark>mourned</mark> her for a very long time... Dad was <u title="">falling apart</u> and couldn't deal with her death, so he started drinking.</p>
        
        <p>And then everything went wrong. He was fired from his job and was barely making any money. And almost all the money he did make, he spent on alcohol.</p>
        
        <p>It was terrible when he got drunk. His <u title="">mood</u> was like a roller coaster. At first he would cry, then scream and get angry. Then my brother Bruce took on the role of father in our family. He always protected and cared for me.</p>
        
        <p>For three years we struggled with <mark>misfortune</mark>, but things got better. We talked a lot with my dad, and he started drinking less. Bruce turned 18 and found a good paying job. We had hope for a normal future.</p>
        
        <p>But in one night, everything got turned upside down. One day on a weekend, dad got us a surprise. He had bought tickets to a baseball game!</p>
        
        <p><u title="">Hurray!</u></p>
        
        <p>We were going to spend the day like a normal family. Dad took us to the stadium and we watched the game. Bruce and I were so happy! But it couldn't have been that good. Dad <u title="">ended up</u> meeting his friends and left us to watch the game with them. We agreed to meet near the car in two hours. But when the game ended, our dad never came. We tried to call him, but he just wouldn't answer.</p>
        
        <p>We stood by the car for over an hour and he finally showed up. He could barely stand on his own two feet! <u title="">Apparently</u>, he had gotten drunk with his friends. It really <mark>pissed Bruce off</mark>, and <u title="">ruined</u> his evening. He took dad's keys and said he'd drive us himself. We got in the car and <mark>drove off</mark>.</p> 
        
        <p>But dad was <u title="">aggressive</u>, he kept telling Bruce how to drive, and it was really annoying him. They were fighting and <u title="">yelling at</u> each other. I didn't want to hear it, so I just closed my eyes and put my hands over my ears. But then it felt like the car jumped, and when I opened my eyes, the last thing I saw was the <mark>windshield</mark> breaking.</p>
        
        <p>When I woke up, I didn't know where I was. I raised my head and saw my brother. He was sitting next to me, covered in <mark>scratches</mark> and <u title="">bruises</u>. I was immediately frightened, but he calmed me down. He said everything was fine. We had been in an accident, but we're lucky because we were almost unharmed. I <mark>exhaled</mark>.</p> 
        
        <p>Then I asked where our dad was. Bruce said he was fine, he's just in the other room. But then I remembered their fight and I said, "We crashed because he <u title="">distracted</u> you, right?." This question made my brother think for a moment. Then he said, "Listen, Chris. The police came... They asked about the accident, and I told them that our father was driving, not me."</p> 
        
        <p>Then my brother said he might have a problem with it, but that it would be better for all of us if the police thought that my father was driving. Maybe he will be forced to go into <mark>rehab</mark> or something. There was something strange about this <u title="">proposal</u>, but I believed my brother and decided to support him.</p>
        
        <p>After this conversation, Bruce was <u title="">relieved</u>. He said we could go home in the morning, and that I needed to sleep. But I couldn't sleep. I was worried I'd have to lie and I tried to calm myself down. I wanted a water, and I couldn't find it in my room, so I went out into the hallway.</p>
        
        <p>I have to say, hospital <u title="ngày 96">corridors</u> at night look just like they do in horror movies, and you don't expect anything good from them. I kept looking for someone to ask for water, but there was no one around. I walked down the hall to the end, and when I turned the corner, I saw a little girl crying at the entrance to someone's room. I went to her and I wanted to calm her down, but she wouldn't stop crying.</p>
        
        <p>I asked her what happened and she said her dad was biking home from work, and he got hit by a car, and now he's <u title="">in a coma</u>. I figured out that it was us right away. We were the ones who hit him! What's more, my brother was driving, and he's trying to <u title="ngày 171">hide</u> it!</p>
        
        <p>This changed everything. It was not just an accident, this was a <u title="">crime</u>, and Bruce was trying to <mark>set our father up</mark>! Yeah, he's a drunk, and my brother was only driving because of him, but he's not guilty! I ran back to the room and I woke Bruce up. I started yelling, "Bruce, we didn't just have an accident, you hit a man! Dad is going to jail, do you understand? You have to <u title="ngày 151">confess</u> everything!"</p>
        
        <p>I started arguing with my brother. He said, "You want me to go to jail? I know it's bad, but think about it, who's gonna take care of you? Dad?"</p>
        
        <p>Then I said that it didn't matter. A little girl was sitting in the hallway and has no idea whether her father will survive or not. And it was because of Bruce. It was a very difficult choice. One of my loved ones would be in prison, and I had to choose who it would be. And it's not a choice between right and wrong.</p>
        
        <p>But I already <u title="">made up my mind</u> when I saw that girl. The truth can be unpleasant and painful, but I didn't want to make a deal with my <u title="">conscience</u>. So I had to find dad and the <u title="">cops</u> and tell them everything.</p>
        
        <p>When I went down to the entrance, I saw dad being led out by two policemen. I ran up to him and wanted to tell him everything, but my father stopped me. He asked the officers for a few minutes to talk to me. In private, he told me to keep it a secret that Bruce was driving.</p>
        
        <p>It <u title="">turned out</u> that dad had told the police that he was driving, and that he hit the cyclist. I tried to stop him, but he made that decision on his own. It looked like he really felt guilty about it.</p>
        
        <p>He was taken away. So, now it's just my brother and me. A few weeks later, we were allowed to see our Dad. He apologized to us for the past three years. He said he lied to the police because it would be better for both of us and Bruce can really take care of me.</p>
        
        <p>Later we found out that the cyclist had started to recover, and will be fine. It does not <mark>absolve</mark> us of guilt, but I am very happy that this little girl will have her father back.</p>
        
        <p>Then there was a trial and dad went to prison. It's sad, but he gave us a chance to move on with our lives, and we just can't lose it. We're both very <u title="">grateful</u> to our dad. I can't even imagine how my brother feels right now, but he's trying his best to <u title="">justify</u> Dad's <mark>sacrifice</mark>.</p>
        
        <p>And I learned an important lesson - the right choice is not always good or easy, and you have to do everything to make sure your loved ones are safe.</p>
