        <p>Hello everyone! My name is Angela. I have an older sister and her name is Bree. We used to be the best friends ever and shared <mark>virtually</mark> everything. In fact, it recently turned out that we even shared a boyfriend.</p>

<p>Bree has always been “the pretty sister” among the two of us. She was pretty popular at school, and other girls wanted to dress like her and look like her, while boys were sending her tons of love notes and little gifts just to make her give them a smile.</p>

<p>While I was totally average, both <u title="ngày 27">in terms of</u> my grades and my appearance. It’s not that I was ugly or something. It’s just been so hard to grow beside such a beauty, knowing that there was nothing <u title="ngày 50">outstanding</u> about me that other people would <mark>admire</mark>. Despite that, Bree and I were always the best friends ever. She never <mark>bragged</mark> to me or showed off and she was always pretty supportive of me.</p>

<p>Since, as I said, she was older – to be <u title="ngày 166">precise</u>, 2 years older than me, she practically taught me everything that I know about makeup, boys, and relationships. Although, it took a while for her advice to be put into action. You see, all the <u title="ngày 172">decent</u> boys at school were busy trying to attract Bree’s attention, and whenever any of them would come up to me, it ended up with them trying to get to know something about Bree’s <mark>preferences</mark>.</p>

<p>Anyway, one day a new family arrived on our street, and my mom, as usual, decided to go and greet the new neighbors. Bree refused to support our mom, ‘cause she was busy getting ready for a date with another guy, while I still had nothing else to do, so I went across the street together with mom.</p>

<p>As <mark>fate</mark> would have it, that new nice family had a son named Dave. He was my age, he looked really handsome and he was going to go to the same school that me and Bree were attending. Oh and he was going to study in the same grade as me. After 5 minutes of greetings there, I couldn’t get Dave out of my head.</p>

<p>Of course, I told Bree about that and she was so happy for me. She even told me that I was extremely lucky, ‘cause with the two of us studying in the same class and living on the same street, that would mean plenty of chances to start dating and so on.</p>

<p>So yes, I was totally excited about that and for some strange reason, this time I was pretty sure that I would finally get myself a boyfriend. It turned out that I was right and that Dave also liked me, when the next day at school, he decided to sit next to me in our biology class, and then he joined me in the cafeteria and then he suggested that he should walk me home…</p>


<p>Dave was awesome! He was smart enough to help me improve my own grades, he was <mark>brought up well</mark> enough to <u title="ngày 118">charm</u> my mom, and he enjoyed baseball which eventually inspired my dad to call him “son,” you know, the whole my family really liked Dave.</p>

<p>But at some point I began noticing that one of us actually started liking him maybe way too much, and I am not talking about me. Whenever Dave came to my place and Bree was also there, she’d <u title="ngày 207">flirt</u> with him <mark>shamelessly</mark>. No, I mean it! She <u title="ngày 11">complimented</u> him, telling him that he looked really good in that shirt, or she'd call him “Davie” or “sweetie” and so on. And whenever they talked to each other, she’d come really close and put her hand on his chest, for example.</p>

<p>It’s not that I was totally against any physical contact between them but, you know what they say about touching somebody during a conversation, right? I tried to drive any unpleasant and jealous thoughts out of my head, telling myself that she was my sister and my best friend and she’d never do anything bad to my relationship. But her behavior became more and more <mark>defiant</mark> from time to time.</p>

<p>For instance, once, Dave and I were going to watch movies at my house, and my parents were out and Bree was getting ready to meet with somebody, so, you know, it was supposed to be a nice evening for just the two of us. But Bree began picking out the perfect outfit for herself and said that she needed a man’s advice, and she started trying on her <mark>figure-hugging</mark> dresses, and tight skinny-jeans with her super-tight shirts and this made me really mad.</p>

<p>I told her that we needed to have a serious talk and took her to another room so that Dave couldn’t hear us. Can you imagine that she <mark>feigned</mark> <mark>utter</mark> surprise while I was asking her to stop flirting with my boyfriend!? She looked as if she couldn’t understand what I was talking about and why I was so mad at her. Honestly, I tried to be kind while I was telling her this, but Bree, sort of, <mark>blew up</mark>. She found the fact that I suggested that she laid eyes on Dave completely <mark>outrageous</mark>. She said that if I was that insecure, I shouldn’t bring my boyfriend home and I should probably go see a <mark>therapist</mark>.</p>

<p>And then she simply left for whatever meeting she had, but my mood was totally <u title="ngày 207">ruined</u>. Of course, Dave noticed that something was wrong between me and Bree, and I was really sad and in <u title="ngày 117">desperate</u> need of <mark>consolation</mark>, so I shared my worries with him. This made Dave smile. It <u title="ngày 145">turned out</u> that, just like Bree, he didn’t notice any flirting between them, and even though there might've been something from her side, it was not a big deal for him, ‘cause the only girl he was interested in was me. Oh, this was so cute. It really calmed me down about jealousy, but now I knew I needed to apologize to Bree for <u title="ngày 52">insulting</u> her.</p>

<p>Well, I apologized and she kind of forgave me, but if you think that she began behaving differently with Dave, you are mistaken. Nothing changed, and maybe now it was even worse because she knew that her “Dave, sweetie” routine really bothered me. I <mark>mulled over</mark> the situation again and again and finally came to the <mark>conclusion</mark> that the only way to teach my sister a lesson, would be to <mark>play hardball</mark>, following her rules.</p>

<p>That time Bree was dating with one guy from the local coffee shop – Chuck. She was saying that these were her most promising relationships and that she thought that she really liked him a lot and so on, so he was kinda the best candidate for being some sort of a <mark>guinea pig</mark> in the realization of my plan. That’s why since then it was me who actually started flirting my sister’s boyfriend whenever he’d come around.</p>

<p>And while for Bree it was quite natural to complement boys and make eyes at them and give them a <u title="ngày 124">mysterious</u> smile and so on, for me the hardest thing was to <u title="ngày 193">overcome</u> my <u title="ngày 122">embarrassment</u>. I will never be able to forget my first attempt at flirting with Chuck when he was in the living room waiting for Bree to come down, and I decided to <u title="ngày 152">give it a shot</u> and go up really close to him to ask how was he doing. Apparently, out of surprise, he started backing away, while I continued to approach, and in the end, he <mark>tripped</mark> on our coffee table and we both fell on the floor - me on top. Both of us began laughing awkwardly, and once we were back on our feet, I saw Bree, who had just come in and saw us. She said nothing and looked like nothing bothered her in this situation, but I continued further.</p>

<p>The next time when I knew that Chuck was coming over, I decided to try on one of Bree’s <mark>frivolous</mark> dresses. Damn, it was so tight and way too short. But since I needed to stick to my plan, I decided to go downstairs to ask Chuck what he thought about me in that dress and whether he thought my Dave would like it. I might be wrong, but when Chuck saw me I think I noticed how his jaw dropped for a second – that’s how good I looked. And as far as Bree was concerned, although she said I looked nice, I couldn’t help but notice how fast she was pushing Chuck out of the house.</p>

<p>Bree said nothing about my behavior, but I <u title="ngày 171">assumed</u> that my plan <u title="ngày 89">worked out</u>, when I heard her speaking on the phone with Chuck at top volume a couple of times. I had a strange and pleasant feeling that I had something to do with that and it made me feel totally <u title="ngày 1">satisfied</u>.</p>

<p>By the way, my fake flirting attempts with Chuck might have changed my own behavior with Dave, ‘cause ever since I started <mark>implementing</mark> my plan, I noticed that he had sort of become even more interested in me. So, this whole situation was a kind of <u title="ngày 148">a win-win</u> for our relationship. I wish I knew back then that I was terribly mistaken.</p>

<p>A couple of weeks passed since I had stopped flirting with Chuck, but Bree was still going around nervous and <u title="ngày 35">irritated</u> whenever she saw him. I guess, they were still fighting with each other. Then I unexpectedly received flowers and my favorite chocolate and a card that said that I was the most beautiful girl in the house. That made Bree grow even weaker. She immediately called Chuck to tell that him that he should be more <mark>attentive</mark> to her if he didn’t want to lose her someday.</p>

<p><mark>Frankly</mark> speaking, a tiny part of me was so satisfied that finally, it wasn’t me who was <mark>envious</mark> of her own sister. Anyway, I decided to go and thank Dave for those flowers and stuff. Imagine my surprise when he kept <u title="ngày 42">denying</u> that he had sent any presents and even got mad and sort of <u title="ngày 52">insulted</u> by the fact that someone might have been trying to <mark>court</mark> me. That sounded really strange and I couldn’t think of anybody else around me that would have done this.</p>

<p>But later that day, I was once again surprised over those flowers and chocolate. It was when Chuck came to our house. Bree was in the shower and I told him to wait for her, and he suddenly asked how I liked the stuff he sent me earlier that day. And while I stood there totally shocked and trying to find the <u title="ngày 119">appropriate</u> words, he continued saying that he had been in love with me for a long time and since he noticed my attention toward him with all the complements and the sexy dress, and he thought that I wouldn’t mind to, you know, be with him.</p>

<p>I was <mark>flattered</mark>, shocked, and totally <mark>outraged</mark> at the same time. I thought that the best way to deal with it was to kick him out of our house and tell Bree about what had happened. And guess what? Good <mark>deeds</mark> never stay unpunished. She <u title="ngày 181">blamed</u> me for everything, we had the biggest fight ever, and didn’t talk to each other for the rest of the day. In the morning I received a text from Dave in which he basically <u title="ngày 153">dumped</u> me. I knew Bree told him everything, but from her own point of view, you know.</p>

<p>So now both my sister and I are suffering from a ruined relationship, and the worst part of it is that we still are in a fight with each other. Do you think I really was wrong in doing what I did? I'll be waiting for your likes and comments.</p>
