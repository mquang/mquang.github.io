      <p>Hi! I’m Rene. I want to share my story of how my own sister almost killed me while she was trying to hide her own secret.</p>

<p>I guess I’d better <u title="">start over</u> and say that I was not born into an <u title="ngày 85">ordinary</u> family. When my parents met each other, both of them already had children from their first marriages. My mom had my sister Rachel, and my dad had my brother Clark. He, I mean, my big brother, <u title="ngày 125">adored</u> me from the very first moment I was born. But he couldn’t find common ground with Rachel. There was hardly a single day where they didn't yell at each other and fight over something.</p>

<p>Since Clark was the oldest child, our parents thought he was supposed to be the more responsible and grown-up one. Besides, Rachel <u title="">had a knack for</u> pretending like he had hurt her. She could literally burst into tears like a true Hollywood actress. So, as usual, Carl would get grounded for any of their fights. But I knew good and well that Rachel was the <mark>troublemaker</mark>. Honestly, now I think that she just needed to be abusive to assert herself or maybe she just naturally had a <mark>nasty</mark> temper. But back then I was too small to come to any conclusions, so, I just felt sorry for my beloved brother and tried to support him whenever he got punished. When, for example, he was sent to his room without dessert, I would manage to <mark>sneak</mark> something delicious out of the fridge so that my mom wouldn’t notice me and quietly bring it to him.</p>

<p>When the time came for Clark to go to college, he promised to keep in touch with me and he actually did. From time to time he would send me <mark>numerous</mark> photos of his life there, and as soon as he found a job and began earning some money, I started receiving sweet little gifts from him. Apparently, this made Rachel so jealous, ‘cause she got nothing from Clark, and she started being really mean to me. Well, it’s not that we were ever friendly before this – we were not even close, but since then she was <mark>harassing</mark> the heck out of me. There were even a few times when she tried to <mark>frame</mark> me in front of our parents. I'll give you a <u title="">vivid</u> example.</p>

<p>Once, Rachel was grounded for having failed her math test. I had started dating a guy back then and we were supposed to go to our first school dance. But because she was mean and <u title="">envious</u>, she got mad at me and threw a pack of cigarettes in my purse. And when Steve, the guy I was dating, came to pick me up, and our parents gathered at the front door to take a photo of us (you know, the kid's first dance thing), and Rachel rushed to me saying that she <u title="">urgently</u> needed my perfume, which she knew was in my purse. And yep, she did this on purpose, to make me reveal that pack of cigarettes to everybody. Of course, it fell out and nobody believed that it wasn’t mine. Anyway, I was not only grounded and had to stay at home for the whole week, but Steve said he didn’t want to date a smoker, duh! So he never showed up again.</p>

<p>There was another case, which perfectly showed that my sister was not only mean, but also revengeful. We were helping our mom with housework, as we usually did, and as a matter of fact, we were arguing with each other while <u title="">polishing</u> <mark>silverware</mark> and cleaning the <mark>porcelain</mark> from the cabinet. She wanted to borrow my <mark>blouse</mark> but I wouldn't let her, ‘cause she was a little bit bigger than me, so to speak, and I didn’t want her to stretch it out. Oh, I wish I had just given this blouse to her… at some point I got so annoyed with Rachel that when I decided to put another cup away that I had finished polishing, it slipped out of my hand and got broken. I know, you’re probably going to say it’s not a big deal, but I didn’t want to make my mom upset since that cup came from a set that was given to our parents on their wedding day.</p>

<p>I <u title="">begged</u> Rachel to not say anything about what happened because I knew I could find the same cup somewhere at a <mark>flea market</mark> or on the internet. And I could just replace it as soon as I found it so that nobody noticed anything. But because of the fact that I told her that she was too fat to wear my clothes, she decided to, sort of, get back at me and she immediately told my mom what I’d done to that cup. Except she said that I did it on purpose, you know, that I just threw it on the floor because I got really annoyed with all the cleaning stuff.</p>

<p>Well, as I said, she had always had a talent that made our mom believe her and not me. Later that day I was supposed to meet my friends at the cinema, and of course, after Rachel <mark>tattled on</mark> me, I was grounded, and couldn’t go anywhere. I guess now you see that Rachel was not that into being close with me.</p>

<p>But recently the worst thing she could’ve done to me happened. Remember, I told you that from time to time Clark sent me nice little presents? Once it was a pair of cute earrings, and another time – it was a book that I had wanted to read for a long time. But he never sent me any money. That’s why the day when I received another envelope from him, I got really surprised to find 200 bucks in there. And the letter attached to it was not really nice... let’s put it that way. Clark <mark>reprimanded</mark> me in this letter for the fact that I should be more careful to not lose my things anymore and also that I should’ve told my parents about everything.</p>

<p>What? I had no idea what he was talking about. I was just standing there re-reading that letter, when Rachel came up to me really fast and <mark>snatched</mark> everything from my hands, saying that this was for her. Oh, this was the biggest fight we ever had! Of course, I demanded explanations from Rachel. When she refused to tell me anything, I tried to call Clark and ask him, but she took my cell phone away. She rushed to her room, shouting at me that this was <u title="">none of my business</u>, and I followed her shouting that if she didn’t explain to me what it was all about, I’d go and tell our parents about that letter. She said that I wouldn’t <mark>dare</mark> or she’d hurt me and she started punching me and we were about to fight, literally. And then I suddenly <u title="ngày 220">tripped</u> and fell downstairs.</p>

<p>I’m not sure what happened next, because when I opened my eyes I found myself in a hospital bed with my left leg <mark>in a cast</mark> and a terrible headache. Rachel was sitting next to me with a <mark>swollen</mark> and tearful face. As soon as she noticed that I was awake, she rushed to me and started <mark>jabbering</mark> something about how sorry she was and begged me not to tell our parents what had happened between us.</p>

<p>I remember that, at first, I couldn’t understand what she was talking about, but then I remembered everything – the money, that nasty letter from Clark, Rachel’s mad face, and me falling down the stairs. Then our parents came in – it turned out that they had gone to the cafeteria. Of course, they rushed to me and started hugging-and-kissing me, and my mom said how worried they were and what a <u title="">relief</u> it was now that I was awake. But I couldn’t take my eyes off of Rachel, who was standing beside them with that begging and <u title="">pitiful</u> look.</p>

<p>It turned out that my leg was broken in two places and I had a <mark>mild</mark> brain <mark>concussion</mark>. And then my mom said that Rachel had already told them that she was in her room when I fell down and that I was lucky that she was at home at all and hurried to call 911.</p>

<p>I’m not sure whether it was the medication that I received, or that I just got really <u title="ngày 220">outraged</u> because Rachel did this to me and lied (again!). But I couldn’t help but tell our parents the truth, or, at least, what I knew about that money, and the letter, and stuff.  This time Rachel had no opportunity to escape from her wrongdoing. She had to <u title="">confess</u> to everything. It turned out that she had gotten pregnant by her boyfriend, and they agreed to collect some money to, you know, un-pregnant her. For obvious reasons, Rachel couldn’t ask our parents for the money. She knew that Clark had money and that he could help, but they were not in that kind of relationship, you know.</p>

<p>So, her boyfriend helped Rachel hack my account and she wrote to Clark as if she were me, making up a nonsense story about a stolen bike and lost school books. Imagine, how well she thought everything out. To avoid the fact that I might receive any unnecessary texts from Clark that could’ve revealed her plan, she told him that I’d been grounded and that mom had taken my cell away. That’s why she begged him not to write anything to me until I got my phone back. You know, so that mom wouldn’t find out anything about what had (assumingly!) happened.</p>

<p>Everybody was in shock when they heard all of this. Even though Rachel was crying hard, it seemed to me that <i><b>neither</b></i> dad <i><b>nor</b></i> mom really felt sorry for her. <u title="">Frankly</u> speaking, both of them looked <u title="">pale</u> and pretty <mark>distant</mark>. Well, if even I was in shock, knowing the fact that she had come up with such an ""almost"" brilliant plan and being aware of how <mark>sly</mark> and mean she’s always been, I can only imagine how my parents felt, who never knew that she was the one who tried to screw up our sibling relationship all the time.</p>

<p>When they all left home, I called Clark. Of course, he already knew about me having to go to the hospital, and now I wanted to tell him everything I’d just found out about Rachel. He said he always knew that she was a strange kid, but he never thought that she was that lonely and <u title="">miserable</u>.</p>

<p>I left the hospital after a couple of days and once I got home I found out that Rachel had already gone. Our parents, being totally disappointed in her, sent her to live at our granny’s house for a while. They purposefully told nothing to me and Carl, as mom said, so they wouldn't upset us. But I guess that they did this because they finally understood that she was not a good person and that she really deserved her punishment.</p>

<p>It’s been a whole week since she’s been there and we still haven’t talked to each other. Honestly, I’m not sure I want to. And yes, nobody in our family supports <mark>abortion</mark>, so Rachel is getting ready to become a mom in a little more than 6 months.</p>

<p>I’ll be waiting for your opinion about my story in the comments to this video. By the way, you’d better be subscribed to this channel so you don't miss a bunch of other interesting stories in the future.</p>
