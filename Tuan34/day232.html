      <p>Hey, guys. I want to tell you how I came up with a plan to get back at my boyfriend, but it all went wrong, and I was left all alone in a big city that scared the crap out of me. Now I regret it more than anything.</p>

<p>My name is Helen, I'm 16 years old, and I'm a student. I like studying, I have a lot of friends at school, and I've been dating an amazing boyfriend for a couple months.</p> 

<p>The only thing that made me uncomfortable was that my parents weren't doing so well. My dad lost his business and we didn't have much money.</p>

<p>Dad always said he wanted to <mark>start over</mark> and that everything would be fine, but he needed a lot of money to do it. How <mark>ironic</mark>, right?</p>

<p>We barely had enough money to live on, and it had a big <mark>impact</mark> on our relationship. My parents were always fighting about it. Dad was very <mark>stubborn</mark>, and at some point, my mother got tired of it, and they decided to divorce.

<p>I don't know if this was a good decision or not, but life has not become easier for any of us. The problem remained the same - we had very little money. And, unexpectedly for me, it affected my relationships as well.</p>

<p>Max and I were just getting started, and we were having this romantic period of endless dates, movies, and gifts.</p>

<p>But the fact is that, for all this, you need money! And I couldn't let Max pay for me everywhere we went, it wouldn't be nice. I tried to hide my lack of money from Max, and I kept making excuses. So every time my boyfriend called me to meet him at a cafe, I immediately did the math in my head: "OK, I'll get a coffee and a slice of cake, plus a tip, that'll be 15 bucks, and if he offers to go to the movies, I'll say I have a lot of homework to do, and we'll go home."</p>

<p>And I did this every time! Max was from a <mark>wealthy</mark> family, and trips to cafes and restaurants were regular things for him.</p>

<p>At some point, I started to fear that he would leave me because I was too poor for him. I've seen how money affects relationships through my parents, and I didn't want that to happen to me.</p>

<p>Every time I had to give up something because I didn't have the money to do it, Max would get really upset. Plus, he was a really nice guy, and he could have easily found another girl. And it made me jealous. And I wasn't just worried. Other girls were always paying attention to him, and we had unpleasant conversations about it.</p>

<p>Gradually, I began to notice that our relationship was <mark>deteriorating</mark>, and there was nothing I could do about it. And pretty soon Max got tired of my constant refusals to spend time together.</p>

<p>Our teacher told us that our class had the opportunity to go to New York for a few days. It was amazing news. Imagine how cool it would be to go there together, and have a good time. We were both very enthusiastic and we talked about it all day. Max said it was a dream trip, and that we should definitely go.</p>

<p>I also had a lot of enthusiasm about it, but I knew that when I asked my mother for money, I would get a negative answer. So that was that. I needed about two hundred dollars for the whole trip, but that amount was too much for my mom, and she said that unfortunately, I would have to stay home.</p>

<p>I was very upset at the time, but I was even more sad after talking to Max. I had to come up with another excuse, but he expected too much from the trip already, and I ruined his dream. That was our last conversation. He said we didn't need a relationship if we couldn't spend time together, and we broke up.</p>

<p>At first I was sad about it, but then I started to get angry. It's just not fair that he dumped me. It's not my fault I can't afford the damn trip! That's a lot of money, after all!</p>

<p>But then something happened at school that just pissed me off. We had a regular class, and I sat there pretending to listen, but my mind was elsewhere. I tried to take my mind off Max, but it was hard because he was sitting right in front of me. I saw him constantly exchanging <mark>glances</mark> with Sarah, who was sitting at the other end of the class. They chatted, and quietly laughed.</p>

<p>Oh, you <mark>scoundrels</mark>! We just broke up yesterday, and he's already texting another girl. I knew that Sarah had liked Max for a long time, but I hadn't expected him to <mark>reciprocate</mark> so quickly. At that moment I was so angry that I decided to get revenge on him.</p>

<p>While everyone was in gym class, I slipped into the locker room, opened his locker, and took the keychain that I made for him. He didn't deserve this gift. But then I saw his wallet.</p> 

<p>Look, I would never have done this under normal <u title="">circumstances</u>, but I was really angry at the time, and I <u title="nảy ra">came up with</u> a plan. I could steal money from him so I could go to New York, too, and ruin Max`s and Sarah's weekend. So I opened his wallet, took 200 bucks out of it, and walked out fast.</p> 

<p>Max discovered that he was missing the money, and our whole class had a serious conversation with the head teacher. He wanted the thief to <u title="(v) thú nhận, thú tội (ngày 151)">confess</u> and return the money. But I sat still, and I wasn't going to do it.</p>

<p>Everyone in class thought I did it. They thought that's how I decided to get back at my boyfriend after our breakup. But I made up an <u title="(n) (ngày 206)">alibi</u>. I wasn't in gym class because I pretended to have a stomachache and I went home from school.</p>

<p>You know what hurts? He didn't even notice that my gift was missing. So I didn't regret what I'd done.</p>

<p>And their investigation <mark>stalled</mark>, so they left me alone. But that was not the end of my plan. I was still gonna go on the road trip and <u title="">have a blast</u>. I thought that then he would regret what he did to me. </p>

<p>The day of the trip came soon. I got on the bus, and as I expected, Max was already sitting next to Sarah. And you should have seen his face when he saw me. Haha, it was so <u title="(ngày 95)">worth it</u>. He thought that I couldn't go. I said that I had decided to relax after breaking up with a fool. BAM!</p>

<p>But that was just the beginning. I was going to keep up with Max and Sarah and make their weekend hell. And I did. I was with them the whole time. I followed them around, messed up their photos, created awkward situations... My plan worked out perfectly and they were very angry with me.</p>

<p>In the evening, when we checked into the hotel, I was put in the same room with Sarah. Honestly, this was too much. I wanted to ruin their weekend, but I wanted to relax, too.</p>

<p>And my sleepover with Sarah didn't turn out the way I had expected. When I was unpacking my backpack in the room, Sarah saw the keychain that I had attached to the inside of my backpack. It was a total accident, and no one was supposed to see it. Sarah noticed that it was the keychain that Max had had for a long time. I tried to think of an excuse, like he gave it to me when we broke up, and I told Sarah to not look at my stuff anymore. But I guess I wasn't lying <u title="">convincingly</u> enough.</p>

<p>In the morning, when I got back on the bus, I noticed that all my classmates were looking at me very strangely, and no one wanted to talk to me. Sarah and Max told everyone what I did, and now my weekend had turned into hell. That key chain was proof that I was the one who'd been searching through Max's locker, and now everyone knew it.</p>

<p>The worst moment was when Sarah turned to me and told me to enjoy the ride because when we got back to school, I was going to be in serious trouble.</p>

<p>At that moment I regretted what I had done and just wanted to burn with <u title="(ngày 110)">shame</u>. All day we went on <mark>excursions</mark>, and I tried not to make eye contact with any of my classmates. I was always at the end of the group, and at one point I lost them. We were in Times Square, there were thousands of people. I looked around for familiar faces, but I couldn't find anyone. I was <mark>terrified</mark>. I didn't have the teacher's number, so I started calling my classmates, but none of them would answer. I guess that's how they decided to punish me for what I had done.</p>

<p>I decided to go to the hotel and wait for them there. But to do this in an unfamiliar city was very difficult.</p>

<p>I couldn't take a cab because I didn't have any money, so I had to take the <mark>subway</mark> and it was the scariest thing I've ever done. I had heard about the New York subway, but I didn't think it was really that bad. I went down to the station, looked at the subway map and just did not understand how and where to go. The letters and names were jumbled together in my head, and I just wanted to cry helplessly. Dozens of people passed me, but none of them even paid attention to my requests for help.</p>

<p>Suddenly I heard a strange screaming. One of those crazy homeless people had walked into the station. He was walking in my direction, <mark>muttering</mark> and shouting. Out of fear, I jumped on a train that had just arrived and left in an unknown direction. I was so scared, I just sat there and started crying.</p>

<p>Then a woman approached me and offered to help. She explained how I could get to the hotel. I couldn't believe that there was someone who wanted to help me. After what I did, I didn't deserve to be treated like this.</p>

<p>When I got back to my room, I had plenty of time to think. I decided to come clean and apologize to Max. The next time when the whole class got together, I called attention to myself, and I told them everything. I was really embarrassed, I promised Max that I would give him his money back, and I asked him not to go to the police.</p>

<p>When we got home from New York, I started looking for a part-time job to pay Max back. But even if I did, my reputation wouldn't be restored. I was very angry, and I did something that I regret now. I think I need to go to another school now and start over.</p>

<p>It's an important lesson I learned. You should always be kind, no matter what people say to you, and how they treat you. Everything that happened to me was completely my fault. And none of this would have happened if I hadn't been so desperate to get back at my ex-boyfriend.</p>

<p>Thank you for listening to my story. Do you think I can make it up to my classmates? And how can I do that? Write what you think in the comments. And don't forget to share this story with your friends.</p>
